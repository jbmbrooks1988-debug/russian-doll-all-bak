<can we just try making social 'music forum' etc. diff apps, 
but connecting later since we already have that 'motivation infra' + speed?
this seems 2 work better 4 YOU 2 ... cuz u can experiment/have diff ui's etc
code isn't '1 size fits all' 
🤯️<- they still want to "pin dances 2 songs" (ur in a kpop soc-subnet...)

👨‍🏫️
whats the deal with having "login" buying? adds , in player etc (like itunes?) just
4 "prep"? = PMF

(id like to be opening "any and all of my gui aps by registering their binarys
as pointer in /bin/ or w/e and clicking them like i choose songs tbh.
<then we could integrate user data <esp metadata> in entirely seperate dir as "HQ" >
🎨️

+ theres diff ways diff apps should run "startup ez" and u may like 2 streamline that
b4 its way 2 late and everything is super diff
_______________🖖🏾️
we may eevn use diff 'gui/hq's and even allow user cust . so at least do 1 !!!

b-b-but i keeop changing names! compensate...🖖🏾️

🗓️
we want app scheduling (backgrounding) 4 user
and also use analystics 4 org...

+ meta comopression of ddata so we dont save all
but grab meaningful insights and save / dash those...
