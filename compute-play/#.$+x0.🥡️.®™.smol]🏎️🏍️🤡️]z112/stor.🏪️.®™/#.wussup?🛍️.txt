sell: ./+x/1.sell]a0.+x
buy: ./+x/1.buy]a0.+x

what should these do ? 

show inventory/ (bag?raw?)  + prices.txt
(should really show "🍎️x 10" or w/e)

allow user to choose +x , check thier inventory 4 money ? take money ; give the thing...


🪙️something that counts  🪙️/state.txt ; subtracts from it or says not enough money 

🎎️theres "no one" "in" the store, theres "no cash register" 
(altho later i would hope we could repourpose this into more of a plugin; start simple)🎎️

🏪️
so what does "interact" do (obv if i have an apple it should do "fx" )
(give user health as its own mod, delete itself + create "seed" as its own mod by reading fx.txt? w/e

interact 4 store/🏪️
🧾️
show inventory with index's? (first show "buy.+x & sell.+x as index's)
(then u can sell using "suggested price (or have ur own price sheet and it can reject it 
and u can just manually change on price sheet 4 now) get it? 
🧾️



🍎️ for something like this fx.txt , 
should the code have to be local? (no it can be in an "fx/" dir and point there in fx.txt")
(u can make it local now 4 dev tho w/e)
🔬️🔭️
(is that anti peice? no not really . since u can just repoint. and those things are consumable;
what about stuff that is so commonplace {dirt banks? idc. im fine with banks, but ; 
things like characters/ cars/ etc. having banks is meh , unless its for a galaxy sim or something; but 
yea the fun/utility is 2 accomodate both using fractal scaling .<- i will certainly make 
"disection tools" for if u wanna get "nitty gritty"})🔬️🪄️the only reason were doing now 
is 2 have the prototypes at the ready...4 refreence on how algo should create them🪄️🔭️







🛍️ should i care about bag vs raw? no not right now we will tighten up once data / fx structure has 
been iterated a couple times and used in sim / production w/e - were aiming for libra, not perfect .c ♎️













🇬🇮️
may seem complicated and i know u wished 2 use modular systems, but we can always have grok orc break it into a
working pipeline after its together... (which it is but im gonna skip for now🇬🇮️
