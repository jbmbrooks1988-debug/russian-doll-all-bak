i want to view status' wether its in split or menu option (tamoguy)
and we want comments in menu paper . ✅️DONE✅️

its showing "old state" what about if i wanna "reset peice"
(typically user wouldn't do that , but dev may...) 
(so just do it by hand... ofc code can do it w/e; button or tool?butool)

(ur really talking about calendar> or everything w/e ) 
(build out fx , code; u coulda done it already;1 val dont bother)

state is missing "hunger/energy" etc... 

eat submenu should show availiable "food types"(or eat w/e)

🦴️<- stuff like amount of blood? wut if cut/shot/bleed? chopped off]PARTS💀️ cut self? get sick ?drink poison? heal? status's?]SPEED-DIE]buttoff?💀️
🫀️(no, more like kenshi, rotting corpse, w/e ; lootable)donor🫀️
🐚️figure out fractal data struct ? fill in from llm? 🐚️
👁️senses affect w/e (waiting on this 4 external lvl)👁️🫁️<= w/e ?🫁️
🥑️look in "inventory" have "mass" of food...chemical makeup etc🥑️
🎒️mass capacity of bag? or not allow {give item hax} 🎒️
(sleep should auto pass hours/days slowly and tell u 
ask how long, but u let u wake up early.)

(y sleep? energy low... <- weights 4 hunger + rest? yes)

📅️<-modify cal seperate from state? add 2 state? w/e but do it. 
(so external env, can follow, including rotation of earth.)🌏️
🪳️i may give him an "ant farm" to look at "zoom.io" /
fractal life banks or w/e etc🪳️🐜️🧺️


🚇️
train = more speed/power w/e + 'level up' wheres level? rmmv 🚇️🔍️
🚇️
🚂️train in place. make steam playable. even shippable like this]DEMO+DISC🚣‍♀️️
then we will go 2 step 2. 
🥇️(yes we ARE doing in place tourney from "enemy bank"🥇️
💴️monetization? metamicro transactions xp]GIT GUD
{hmn can have phone with apps. and buy food/books on it or w/e}
i will give players dollars, and chatbot 4 chinese & u can 
learn chiense with it as an edu-app.(rewards 4 learning chinese)
<rewards u for switching full ui 2 chinese and doing turns in it>
 xpensive app; ios.c?<dev fee.android? steam? rmmv? motiong 4 mmo now!>  💴️

📱️its fine now✅️july29-19:40
we  never tried running a menu thru here. .. and lo and behold it doens't work. 

👨‍🚀️
basically u can add "&"'s and run buttons just like "menu runs sub's"

(this is better than other submenus, cuz we can hide their output even if they woud "interupt")
👨‍🚀️
🐡️i duno how this code works, i assume like orb w/e . back it up; its 111 loc fam8🐡️

📮️
it was a flushing issue, i fixed it in child...]

🇬🇮️
To add support for an optional third column in locations.txt that contains an "&" to redirect output to /dev/null (suppressing output to both the terminal and gl_cli_out.txt), we need to modify the code to parse this additional column and adjust the command string accordingly. The idea is to check for the "&" in each line of locations.txt and, if present, replace the tee -a gl_cli_out.txt redirection with > /dev/null 2>&1 to hide the output. If the "&" is not present, the command will use the original redirection with stdbuf -oL and tee -a.
