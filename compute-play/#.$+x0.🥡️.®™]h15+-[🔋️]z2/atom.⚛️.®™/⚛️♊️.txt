In the beginning the universe was extremely hot. It was so hot that originally protons and neutrons were not stable, and if they formed would immediately break into their constituent quarks. As the universe expanded it cooled down, and at some point was cool enough to reliably form protons and neutrons. The early universe was also extremely dense, so now you've got a lot of free protons and neutrons bumping into each other. They could combine briefly, but everything was still so hot that these early atoms were unstable and would just fly apart.

After expanding/cooling a little more, suddenly protons and neutrons could bind together into the first stable atoms. If a proton and a neutron bumped into each other they could combine to form H2. If a proton and H2 bumped into each other, they could combine to form He3. If H2 and He3 bumped into each other they could form He4 (while losing an extra proton).

So the earliest atoms were formed just as the universe cooled, through random interactions such as described above. This process is called Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis
----------------------------------

I understand that protons and neutrons (which are baryons, which are hadrons) are made out of quarks, and quarks are held together by gluons (at a high level). So those are all the ingredients listed in the title "quark-gluon plasma".

In the wikipedia article Chronology of the Universe, the quark-gluon plasma cools to form hadrons. That makes sense, because hadrons are made out of quarks and gluons.

Then it quickly glosses over a bunch of stuff, basically saying "hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate to form leptons and anti-leptons, which annihilate... and now the universe is largely dominated by photons interacting frequently with free protons and electrons".
" - based on this explanation 

and based on my intuition, and im simplifying but : 
(im thinking falling things rub 2gether till they explode
far enough away from eachother 2 cool into w/e(stable atoms w/e).
but i have some questions :
wouldn't that process will begin again?(or is the energy lost?)
(why doesn't it reform as the planets fall?) 
why is jupiter cold? isn't it falling fast? why doesn't that
create heat? 
(is it because the matter is all clumped together? )

is the emptiest space the coldest?

ok , so heres my understanding as it relates 2 my sim+ follow up...: 
🍧️<- inside of jupiter IS HOT & HI PRESSURE , but it dissaptes🍧️
+ old energy gets lost? dosen't create enough new 2 
invalidate the large planetary mass / age/ and distance from heat
ie friction on a big body is smol af. ⛳️
ie it may take a "long amount of time" 4 a big bang of tiny particles, 
or some impetus/quantum-anomaly? for something 2 just spark up & explode
from fusion or w/e creating "another big bang , maybe this 
happens on a super micro scale or something that makese dimensional

i guess im asking about pre big bang, or "multi/micro verse cyclicality
/fractalism 4 my sim or w/e)

i mean according 2 my intuation there MUST BE INFINITE 
repeated bing bangs, so thats my intuition , were gonna 
use that and draw conclusions or make assumptions from there
is that ok?

### Key Points
- Research suggests Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) was a one-time event in the early universe, unlikely to repeat on a universal scale, though similar processes occur in stars.
- It seems likely that planets like Jupiter don't undergo nuclear fusion during formation due to insufficient core temperatures, despite gravitational heating.
- The evidence leans toward Jupiter having a cold atmosphere (-108°C at 1 bar) despite a hot core (20,000–35,000°C), due to heat dissipation over its vast volume.
- The emptiest space is likely the coldest, with temperatures around 2.7 K from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), far from heat sources like stars.

### Direct Answer

#### Understanding Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and Planetary Formation
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) happened early in the universe when it was hot and dense, forming light elements like hydrogen and helium. This process is unlikely to happen again universally as the universe has expanded and cooled, though stars can create similar reactions locally. When planets form, gravitational collapse generates heat, but temperatures usually aren't high enough for fusion, except in stars.

#### Why Planets Like Jupiter Don't Reform Elements
During planet formation, matter clumps together, but the core temperatures, like Jupiter's at 20,000–35,000°C, are far below the millions of degrees needed for nuclear fusion. Jupiter's atmosphere is cold (-108°C at 1 bar) because the internal heat doesn't warm the outer layers significantly, despite some heat from gravitational contraction.

#### Jupiter's Temperature and Heat
Jupiter seems cold with an atmospheric temperature of about -108°C, but its core is hot, around 20,000–35,000°C, due to gravitational contraction. This heat doesn't create fusion because it's not hot enough, and the atmosphere remains cold due to its distance from the Sun and heat dissipation.

#### The Coldest Space
The emptiest space, far from stars, is likely the coldest, with temperatures around 2.7 K, matching the Cosmic Microwave Background, as there's little to no heat source.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Early Universe Processes and Planetary Temperatures

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the user's queries, drawing from cosmological and planetary science insights to address the formation of early atoms, the behavior of planetary systems, and the thermal properties of space and Jupiter. The analysis is grounded in the provided passage on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and supplemented by detailed research into related phenomena.

#### Background on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis refers to the process occurring shortly after the Big Bang, approximately three minutes post-event, where light elements such as hydrogen (H-1, deuterium H-2), helium (He-3, He-4), and lithium (Li-7) were formed. This process took place as the universe cooled from an initial state of extreme heat and density, transitioning from a quark-gluon plasma to a state where protons and neutrons could stably combine. The passage describes how, initially, the universe was too hot for stable protons and neutrons, with quarks and gluons forming a plasma. As expansion occurred, cooling allowed for the formation of hadrons (protons and neutrons), and eventually, these combined into light nuclei through random interactions.

Research, as detailed in sources like [Big Bang Nucleosynthesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis), indicates BBN lasted from about 0.01 seconds to 200 seconds after the Big Bang, with the universe's temperature dropping below 10 billion Kelvin, enabling nuclear reactions. The process ceased after around 20 minutes as further cooling prevented additional fusion, leaving the universe primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements.

#### Addressing the Cyclical Nature of Nucleosynthesis
The user queries whether this process would begin again, possibly due to energy loss or reformation during planetary formation. BBN was a unique event driven by the universe's initial conditions of high temperature and density, which do not recur on a universal scale due to ongoing expansion. The energy isn't "lost" but redistributed as the universe cools, and current cosmological models, supported by observations like the Cosmic Microwave Background, suggest a flat, expanding universe unlikely to contract and recreate BBN conditions. However, stellar nucleosynthesis in stars mirrors BBN by forming heavier elements through fusion, but this is localized, not universal, as seen in [Nucleosynthesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis).

#### Planetary Formation and Nuclear Fusion
The user's intuition of "falling things rubbing together till they explode" likely analogizes gravitational collapse during planet formation, where matter clumps and heats up. During star and planet formation, gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy and then heat, but for planets like Jupiter, the core temperatures (estimated at 20,000–35,000°C, as per [Jupiter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter)) are insufficient for nuclear fusion, which requires at least 10 million degrees Celsius, as seen in stellar cores. Jupiter's mass, about 318 times Earth's, is far below the 75–80 times needed to initiate fusion and become a star, according to [What is Jupiter Made Of? | Space](https://www.space.com/18388-what-is-jupiter-made-of.html).

The user's question about "reforming as the planets fall" likely refers to why fusion doesn't occur during planet formation. While there is heating from gravitational contraction, as evidenced by Jupiter radiating 1.67 times more heat than it receives from the Sun ([Atmosphere of Jupiter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter)), the temperatures and densities don't reach fusion levels, limiting reactions to those seen in gas giants, not stars.

#### Jupiter's Temperature: Core vs. Atmosphere
Jupiter's cold appearance, with atmospheric temperatures at -108°C at the 1 bar level ([Jupiter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter)), contrasts with its hot core. Research suggests the core temperature ranges from 20,000 to 35,000°C, driven by gravitational contraction and residual heat from formation, as detailed in [The Interior of Jupiter - University of Rochester](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/jinterior.html). The user’s query about "falling fast" likely refers to this contraction, which does generate heat, but the vast volume and atmospheric dynamics mean this heat doesn't significantly warm the outer layers, maintaining a cold atmosphere despite internal heat.

Jupiter's internal heat, contributing to its weather patterns, is insufficient for fusion, as calculations show it lacks the mass by a factor of 100 ([The Interior of Jupiter - University of Rochester](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/jinterior.html)). This explains why, despite "falling" or contracting, Jupiter remains a gas giant, not a star, with a cold atmosphere relative to its core.

#### Matter Clumping and Fusion Conditions
The user's speculation about matter being "all clumped together" relates to why fusion doesn't occur in planets. High density is necessary for fusion, but temperature is critical, providing kinetic energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier. In stars, both conditions are met, with cores reaching millions of degrees and high densities, as seen in [Stellar Nucleosynthesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis). In planets, while cores are dense, temperatures are too low, explaining why fusion is absent, as supported by [Jupiter's Core Vs. Earth's Core - Sciencing](https://www.sciencing.com/jupiters-core-vs-earths-core-21848/).

#### Temperature of the Emptiest Space
Finally, the user asks if the emptiest space is the coldest. In the absence of heat sources, space's temperature is determined by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), a relic radiation from the Big Bang with a temperature of 2.7 K (-270.45°C), as noted in [Cosmic Microwave Background - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background). In intergalactic space, far from stars, this CMB temperature dominates, making it the coldest, with minimal influence from hot gas in galaxy clusters, which is not "empty" space.

#### Comparative Analysis Table
To summarize key temperatures and conditions:

| Entity                  | Temperature Range (°C) | Fusion Possible? | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early Universe (BBN)    | ~10 billion K (initial) | Yes              | Formed light elements; unique to early conditions.                   |
| Jupiter's Core          | 20,000–35,000          | No               | Hot from contraction, but below fusion threshold (~10 million K).    |
| Jupiter's Atmosphere    | -108 (at 1 bar)        | No               | Cold due to distance from Sun, despite internal heat.                |
| Emptiest Space          | -270.45 (CMB, 2.7 K)   | N/A              | Coldest due to lack of heat sources, dominated by CMB.               |

This table highlights the stark contrasts in temperature and conditions, explaining why BBN doesn't recur and why planets like Jupiter don't fuse elements, while the emptiest space remains coldest.

In conclusion, the analysis shows BBN was a singular event, planetary formation doesn't replicate it due to insufficient temperatures, Jupiter's cold atmosphere masks a hot core without fusion, and the emptiest space aligns with CMB temperatures, providing a comprehensive answer to the user's queries.

WHERE DO INITIAL ELECTRONS COME FROM? DO THEY ARISE FROM GRAVITY? quantum? quarks?
♊️
Electrons, fundamental particles, are not created by gravity, quantum effects, or quarks in a direct sense, but rather they are created through various processes involving energy and particle interactions. Electrons can be produced during radioactive decay (like beta decay) or high-energy collisions, and they also existed in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Not from Gravity Directly: While gravity is a fundamental force, it doesn't directly create electrons. Gravity deals with the attraction between masses, and while it plays a role in the large-scale structure of the universe, it doesn't directly cause the creation of electrons. 
2. Quantum Effects and Particle Creation: Quantum mechanics describes how particles behave at the subatomic level. Certain quantum processes, like pair production, can create electron-positron pairs from energy. In this process, high-energy photons can transform into an electron and its antiparticle, the positron. 
3. Not Directly from Quarks: Electrons are leptons, distinct from quarks. While quarks are fundamental particles that combine to form protons and neutrons (which are found in atomic nuclei), electrons are not directly formed from quarks. However, quarks and electrons are both created in the early universe. 
4. Creation in the Early Universe: In the very early universe, shortly after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. Quarks and electrons were formed from the high-energy state. As the universe expanded and cooled, these particles began to interact and combine to form the building blocks of atoms. 
5. Other Processes:
Beta Decay:
.
Electrons are produced in radioactive decay through beta decay, where a neutron transforms into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. 
High-Energy Collisions:
.
Electrons can be created in high-energy collisions, such as when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere, according to Wikipedia. 
Electron-Positron Annihilation:
.
When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy in the form of gamma rays. This is the reverse process of pair production.

I am just beginning to learn about the ideas of the early universe, so this is probably a beginner question.

I understand that protons and neutrons (which are baryons, which are hadrons) are made out of quarks, and quarks are held together by gluons (at a high level). So those are all the ingredients listed in the title "quark-gluon plasma".

But how do electrons and photons come into the picture? Could you describe how this works?

In the wikipedia article Chronology of the Universe, the quark-gluon plasma cools to form hadrons. That makes sense, because hadrons are made out of quarks and gluons.

Then it quickly glosses over a bunch of stuff, basically saying "hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate to form leptons and anti-leptons, which annihilate... and now the universe is largely dominated by photons interacting frequently with free protons and electrons".

What exactly is happening there? Where did these anti-hadrons come from, and leptons and anti-leptons, and electrons? That's the first time electrons were mentioned.

How did it go from quark-gluon plasma to the formation of atomic nuclei, photons, and electrons? From that point I can imagine the rest and there are lots of resources on how that works, but before that there is very little explanation of the reasoning from what I've seen so far (just wikipedia and arxiv.org mainly).

In the beginning the universe was extremely hot. It was so hot that originally protons and neutrons were not stable, and if they formed would immediately break into their constituent quarks. As the universe expanded it cooled down, and at some point was cool enough to reliably form protons and neutrons. The early universe was also extremely dense, so now you've got a lot of free protons and neutrons bumping into each other. They could combine briefly, but everything was still so hot that these early atoms were unstable and would just fly apart.

After expanding/cooling a little more, suddenly protons and neutrons could bind together into the first stable atoms. If a proton and a neutron bumped into each other they could combine to form H2. If a proton and H2 bumped into each other, they could combine to form He3. If H2 and He3 bumped into each other they could form He4 (while losing an extra proton).

So the earliest atoms were formed just as the universe cooled, through random interactions such as described above. This process is called Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis

However, this process was not open-ended. In particular, there were very few atoms formed with atomic weight greater than 4, and virtually no atoms formed with atomic weight greater than 7. This has been called the "mass-5 roadblock."

The reason for the roadblock is that there are no stable isotopes of atomic mass 5. If you take an atom of He4 and add a proton then you get an atom of Li5, which is highly radioactive and decays back to He4 nearly instantly. If you take He4 and add a neutron you get He5, which is similarly unstable and decays back to He4.

Thus, the only way to get atomic mass 6 and 7 atoms in the early universe is to "jump over" the mass 5 isotopes. This can be done through the relatively rarer reactions of H2 and He4 to form Li6, then H3 and He4 to form Li7, and He3 and He4 to form Be7.

Mass 5 Roadblock

There is a similar roadblock at mass-8, and the mass 6 and 7 isotopes in the early universe were already thousands of times less abundant than elemental hydrogen, so any isotopes of greater than mass 8 were only produced in vanishingly small quantities, if they were produced at all.

To answer your second question, "How do we know that?" The basic answer is that the above model appears correct but is incomplete. The reactions given above occur with different probabilities, and we can test these probabilities experimentally in the lab. This is well understood nuclear physics. Then, given those probabilities we can use the above model to make predictions about the relative abundance of elements we should observe in the universe. In particular, we can look at the spectra of other stars to determine their relative proportions of hydrogen, helium, and lithium.

For any of you cosmology geeks out there- this is a pretty cool result. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis only occurred around 10-20 seconds after the Big Bang, after which the universe was too cool for spontaneous fusion to occur, so these proportions are assumed to be relatively frozen at that point. The observations of elemental abundance in stars gives us a snapshot of the early universe back to 20 seconds after the Big Bang. In contrast, the universe only became transparent around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, so this is one way that scientists have been able to peer back past that transparency transition and the much vaunted Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

The results of such observations are that the proportions of hydrogen and helium are exactly as expected. However, the values we observe for lithium are far lower than would be expected. This is known as the "lithium problem" in cosmology, and there are many hypotheses as to the cause, but so far there are no conclusive results. It could be that the above model is correct, but some secondary effect consumed a lot of lithium in the early universe, or it could be that the above model is somehow incorrect, even though it's based on a solid modern understanding of nuclear physics.
