⬜️📌️

want this logic : 
if no state , so what , just means map cant move  

if no map , so what, just means render 1 block


if state but "no size/ position" 
w/e should be on map. 

adv : map has coords but so does state? override/overwrite map i guess. w/e <- yes. 

🔳️
ok. first thing. theres no super state. yes . make a button now <3

🎥️also. i think we put the camera plugin in "box" and just adjust paths. w/e ]+clean kruft.txt's🎥️

🗡️sword has its own menu. or is it box plugin again? wut gives u control of sword, 🖇️
literal login? but wut tho? = a plugin , right? 
a plugin from button box that adjusts sword position & dir could work, 
then u wouldnt need 2 touch sword directly , this maybe the common sense missing link 🖇️🗡️




but wut if i want to touch sword w/o login? 
first of all u cant, so.. (otherwise it would need 2 run button 4 cam, or symlink a cam @ this point)
(u use a "controller") ignore sword...more important is clock-link-updates]gameloop

🔲️
this may be the most important thing at this point. get it done fast pls🔲️

(pressing button can setup maps {&start clock/ai} w/o turning on a camera btw)

*original coords dont matter, but its not rocket science (we will have mc-biome/world gen later)

📬️
the problem im seeing is that "peices have camera coordinates"
really it should be 'what'? that person controlling should? u REALLY NEED TO BORE THRU THIS STUF
just 2 get us up and running enough 2 go 2 '2d'📬️
