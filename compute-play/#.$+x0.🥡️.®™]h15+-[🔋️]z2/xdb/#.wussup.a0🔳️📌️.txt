want this logic : 
if no state , so what , just means map cant move  

if no map , so what, just means render 1 block


if state but "no size/ position" 
w/e should be on map. 

adv : map has coords but so does state? override/overwrite map i guess. w/e <- yes. 

🔳️
ok. first thing. theres no super state. yes . make a button now <3

🎥️also. i think we put the camera plugin in "box" and just adjust paths. w/e ]+clean kruft.txt's🎥️

🗡️sword has its own menu. or is it box plugin again? wut gives u control of sword, 🖇️
literal login? but wut tho? = a plugin , right? 
a plugin from button box that adjusts sword position & dir could work, 
then u wouldnt need 2 touch sword directly , this maybe the common sense missing link 🖇️🗡️

but wut if i want to touch sword w/o login? 
first of all u cant, so.. (otherwise it would need 2 run button 4 cam, or symlink a cam @ this point)
