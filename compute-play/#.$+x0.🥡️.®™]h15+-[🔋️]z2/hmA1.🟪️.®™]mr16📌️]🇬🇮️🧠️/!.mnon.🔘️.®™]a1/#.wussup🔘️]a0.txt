i want to view status' wether its in split or menu option (tamoguy)
and we want comments in menu paper . ✅️DONE✅️

its showing "old state" what about if i wanna "reset peice"
(typically user wouldn't do that , but dev may...) 
(so just do it by hand... ofc code can do it w/e; button or tool?butool)

(ur really talking about calendar> or everything w/e ) 
(build out fx , code; u coulda done it already;1 val dont bother)

state is missing "hunger/energy" etc... 

eat submenu should show availiable "food types"(or eat w/e)

🦴️<- stuff like amount of blood? wut if cut/shot/bleed? chopped off]PARTS💀️ cut self? get sick ?drink poison? heal? status's?]SPEED-DIE]buttoff?💀️
🫀️(no, more like kenshi, rotting corpse, w/e ; lootable)donor🫀️
🐚️figure out fractal data struct ? fill in from llm? 🐚️
👁️senses affect w/e (waiting on this 4 external lvl)👁️🫁️<= w/e ?🫁️
📟️for "states of health" there should be anatomy, 
but wouldn't show in main menu,  u need to go in submenu
(maybe even rmmv dosen't show. just basic. and fractal/sub drilldown..)
<on weight exchange compats PATH>💱️

💞️
they had the nerve (while clown freeze) 2 suggest
i make the "peices" run idivisual or "bank riscv-" machines
(using c- instead of ♋️middle man ♋️
im gonna prompt for "2bit dumbed down riscv computer
then straup up 2 4 bit , a8bit 16,and finally 32 (it brakes on 64)

but i think we can strap a tiny c+ast in those tiny risc's
as well...
sometimes try 2 use those 4 calculation

(were still buidinng LLM @ home, and maybe that will be helpful4 that
2 infuse train right away. and grok will be good @ this...
(u should use existing halo netlist infra if possible...
instead of running in "c")

i'dhave liked 2 looka bit more @ peice stuff and maybe 
will do basic  2 death stuff... 

may make a "robot peice" as apposed 2 human
who doesn't eat and stuff.  = rvBT.🤖️.®™      🎛️
💞️
🫀️ok, but wut about bio machines arising from phy/bio-chem?🫀️
u should speed thru that 2 . go back and forht w/e;
----------
rv kinda bogs us down, but i maybe wrong
it maybe faster (than bio , mid-sim stuff 4 grok...🎛️
🀄️treat it like u did school + ai + ? networking, 
maybe 2 know ur ready u can do "networking + riscv" right? 

<yes i mean literal radio wave(sim&real) & ethernet etc>
🐉️🀄️
🫀️
🥑️look in "inventory" have "mass" of food...chemical makeup etc🥑️
🎒️mass capacity of bag? or not allow {give item hax} 🎒️
(sleep should auto pass hours/days slowly and tell u 
ask how long, but u let u wake up early.)

(y sleep? energy low... <- weights 4 hunger + rest? yes)

🗑️{deleted peices? history @ least? w/e}🗑️

📅️<-modify cal seperate from state? add 2 state? w/e but do it. 
(so external env, can follow, including rotation of earth.)🌏️
🪳️i may give him an "ant farm" to look at "zoom.io" /
fractal life banks or w/e etc🪳️🐜️🧺️


🚇️
train = more speed/power w/e + 'level up' wheres level? rmmv 🚇️🔍️
🚇️
🚂️train in place. make steam playable. even shippable like this]DEMO+DISC🚣‍♀️️i kinda think this shows ur 1 player loop is good enough 2 go into 2 player; not that it has much stats/ life/death.

can we prompt a full body system of anatomy , 
that just does "basic bodily processes , and allows io?"
if so lets do that. something we can scale (like our riscv stuff)

💪️
should bone be in "arm , or skeletal"? w/e but ur model should convert
💪️
🇬🇮️
what would a data model of a minimal foundation for a medically 
useful anatomy simulation look like? 

(im gonna want brain/nerves 2 feel, oxygen for blood , circulation of blood
bones that can break, skin that can bleed. stomach that can eat
and body that ages , can die , etc 
for reference,user can lose limbs, take on prosthetics, etc 
and can even reproduce and combine genetics with "male/female"
(so it should go all the way to chemical makeup/dna/ protiens)
(optionally , most game functions wont focus on this 
so maybe we think of "seperate data sheets with
in state.txt pointer to seperate sheets...
(were keeping things matrix based)
basically the body updates every turn from external functions
(like how a rougelike works, user selects "next turn" (or puts on clock pulse)
(like feed.c , sleep.c etc ; we will talk about the data model now
and address the most relevant funtions after)

here is an example of my bare bones current implimentation.
🏋‍♂️️
then we will go 2 step 2. 
🥇️(yes we ARE doing in place tourney from "enemy bank"🥇️
💴️monetization? metamicro transactions xp]GIT GUD
{hmn can have phone with apps. and buy food/books on it or w/e}
i will give players dollars, and chatbot 4 chinese & u can 
learn chiense with it as an edu-app.(rewards 4 learning chinese)
<rewards u for switching full ui 2 chinese and doing turns in it>
 xpensive app; ios.c?<dev fee.android? steam? rmmv? motiong 4 mmo now!>  💴️
💦️ (it can learn anything after , jailbrake. fap. sex in mmo/pvp.]GO!!💦️
🧠️how learn ? store memories based on associations 
of things u already know. set memory window. 2 prune if smol+
reward if helpful/reused/reinforced by other contexts🧠️

📅️july29-19:41📅️📅️📅️📅️📅️

does button still launch 3d? (y wouldn't it? ) ]YES. im sure theres caveats.
just make a game.

(we wanted to make mr first. dosen't need 3d/location/ superstuff but can add later)
🚇️BAQ ON TRAQ🚇️
🎭️we had to make a new menu system, and its not completely up 2 date so ref OG]

📱️its fine now✅️july29-19:40
we  never tried running a menu thru here. .. and lo and behold it doens't work. 

👨‍🚀️
basically u can add "&"'s and run buttons just like "menu runs sub's"

(this is better than other submenus, cuz we can hide their output even if they woud "interupt")
👨‍🚀️
🐡️i duno how this code works, i assume like orb w/e . back it up; its 111 loc fam8🐡️

📮️
it was a flushing issue, i fixed it in child...]
📮️


🇬🇮️
To add support for an optional third column in locations.txt that contains an "&" to redirect output to /dev/null (suppressing output to both the terminal and gl_cli_out.txt), we need to modify the code to parse this additional column and adjust the command string accordingly. The idea is to check for the "&" in each line of locations.txt and, if present, replace the tee -a gl_cli_out.txt redirection with > /dev/null 2>&1 to hide the output. If the "&" is not present, the command will use the original redirection with stdbuf -oL and tee -a.
