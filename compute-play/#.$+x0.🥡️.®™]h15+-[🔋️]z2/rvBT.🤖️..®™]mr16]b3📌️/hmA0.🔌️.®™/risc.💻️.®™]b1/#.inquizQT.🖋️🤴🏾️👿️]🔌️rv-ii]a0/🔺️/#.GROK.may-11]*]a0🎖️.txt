for modularity and reuse
id like to break
 the tangential functions of this up into executable modules (seperate .c files)
{i dont want to link them on compile or use externs, i want them to beable to be self contained aside from data io}
and executing them with system(); ex : system(./+x/"xor.+x 16 0 1"); when they are needed.
(or pipes)
if we need to share data among modules it should be easy because we shoud be writing 
to one of the auto save file, so we can just read and write from those ( or pipes)

our executables are compiled as ".+x" and stored in "/+x/"

Each C file is standalone, avoiding headers.


Everything is built from NAND gates, scaled to 32 bits for RISC-V. This covers the core requirements—let me know if you want details on any specific part!

is there any way we can modularize this codebase. 
i dont wanna force it , but if we can factor any reusable modules out
that shouldn't be cluttering main.c file, lets go. (feel free to correct any obviously errors in my risc-v logic as well, im a newb)

then we can continue trying to build our risc-v emu to the point where it can boot tiny_linux_32.iso
(like qemu) <- lets make a design-dox.md to outline code-principles, next steps +kpis 4 future sessions.

i want to implement all the modules but keeping them compartmentalized is a good idea. ideally the main file could be used to do any architecture or chip (ex z80 , arm , x86 etc) .so lets organize the code in this way . in order to actually peices the riscv architecture i dont want it hardcoded in . i want it to read the "netlist" chip connections from a specific file .txt that specifies something like :  "./+x/chip1.+x arg1 arg2 out1.txt out2.txt ./+x/chip2.+x out1.txt out3.txt ... get it ? lets update design doc to communicate that please, and then we should get started on "gates" plus main.c file making sure the emulator can run simple gates, we will make a test.sh for automation

sh zsh
.test.emu.sh 
NAND(1,1) = 0: PASS
NOT(1) = 0: FAIL (got 1)  {i remove compile logic from script. i already have one and it breaks in this one<3} lets keep making the new gates and netlists for bigger gates. we will build and test step by step (all gates should be made from previous gates in a netlist file, multiple netlist files can be used from script or w/e) does that make sense? did you already know that or do you need to modify design doc/steps&kpis?
