🌟 Super-Simple Serial HDL Emulator for NAND-Based Chips 🛠️✨
🎯 Goal
Build a minimal, serial HDL emulator for NAND-based chips (e.g., RV-II, a 2-bit computer) 📟, inspired by NAND2Tetris (HALQ) and my emulator (3.hnlq🪞️nos]17]PURE.c). Process one NAND operation per cycle, with all chip logic (signals, accumulator, PC increment) defined in the netlist. Use only dynamically allocated arrays (1MB or more), no structs, no hardcoded signals or counts, and keep it KISS (keep it simple, stupid)! 😎 No quantum mode, no input file—just initialize state with zeros and use ./tmp/input.txt, ./tmp/output.txt, ./tmp/state.txt. Ensure robust memory and file handling for complex directories. 🚀
🐛 Current Problem
Old code had hardcoded signals (e.g., REG0_0), fixed counts (18), extra arguments (e.g., expected_lines, --stateful), and seg
