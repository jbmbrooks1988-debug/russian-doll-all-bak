they had the nerve (while clown freeze) 2 suggest
i make the "peices" run idivisual or "bank riscv-" machines
(using c- instead of ♋️middle man ♋️
im gonna prompt for "2bit dumbed down riscv computer
then straup up 2 4 bit , a8bit 16,and finally 32 (it brakes on 64)

but i think we can strap a tiny c+ast in those tiny risc's
as well...
sometimes try 2 use those 4 calculation

(were still buidinng LLM @ home, and maybe that will be helpful4 that
2 infuse train right away. and grok will be good @ this...
(u should use existing halo netlist infra if possible...
instead of running in "c")

i'dhave liked 2 looka bit more @ peice stuff and maybe 
will do basic  2 death stuff... 

may make a "robot peice" as apposed 2 human
who doesn't eat and stuff.
