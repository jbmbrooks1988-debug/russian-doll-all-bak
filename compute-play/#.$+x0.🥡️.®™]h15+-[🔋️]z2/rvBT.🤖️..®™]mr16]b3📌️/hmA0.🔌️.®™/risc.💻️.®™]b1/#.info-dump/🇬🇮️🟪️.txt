stripped down version i can show grok? 

we have turns but i want a bit more infra ; 

id rather show it less. but have more. ]

add chatbot early btw with context of self/state ,etc 

ie : are u hungry ? 

(it may not know what it needs, can u "tell it"
(user commands are "highest priority" , etc)+ str8 up automation

vs "loyalty automation ie mix of both"

-------
i kinda wanna switch 🔐️ b4 going forward...

now im wanting 🖼️.txt instead of state.txt all cosmetic. 
but helps me know wutssup tbh.

>>
i kinda wanna hash state , so i will just wait till i do both, 
which maybe when its more appropriate...

🤖️how does rvii++ does this? {inc hunger/w/e}
will just run "rvii++ -> pointing 2 w/e program 2 modify io
(try with simple stuff first, such as incriment...add1 , etc)

{word context() may actually help 4 coding, also 0b isn't very human readable; so not 2 stop u , just make infra tools imo. ; 
including helping it get better at explaining its meta reasoning}
