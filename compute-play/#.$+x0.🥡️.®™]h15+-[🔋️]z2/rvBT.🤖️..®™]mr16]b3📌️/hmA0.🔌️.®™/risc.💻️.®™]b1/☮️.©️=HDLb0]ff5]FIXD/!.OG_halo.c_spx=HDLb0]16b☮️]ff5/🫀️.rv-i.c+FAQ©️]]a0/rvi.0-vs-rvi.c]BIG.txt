### Direct Answer

**Key Points:**
- It seems likely that RV-I is a 1-bit educational computer inspired by RISC-V, with simple components for learning.
- Research suggests it has 4 1-bit registers, 16 1-bit memory locations, a 4-bit program counter, and supports NAND, LOAD, STORE, and JUMP instructions.
- The evidence leans toward it running on the HDLb0 emulator, using 16-bit binary instructions for simulation.

**What is RV-I?**
RV-I appears to be a custom, simplified version of a RISC-V-like processor, designed for educational purposes. It’s a 1-bit system, meaning each register and memory location holds just one bit, making it easy to understand basic computing concepts.

**How It Works**
RV-I has:
- **Registers**: 4 registers (r0 to r3), each 1-bit, stored in RAM locations 0-3.
- **Memory**: 16 1-bit memory locations (mem[0-15]), stored in RAM 4-19.
- **Program Counter**: A 4-bit counter (stored in RAM[20]) to track the current instruction.
- **Instructions**: Four operations:
  - NAND: Performs a logic operation, like `r1 = ~(r1 & r2)`.
  - LOAD: Copies a memory bit to a register, e.g., `r1 = mem[0]`.
  - STORE: Saves a register bit to memory, e.g., `mem[1] = r1`.
  - JUMP: Changes the program counter, e.g., `pc = r1 * 2`.

It runs on the HDLb0 emulator, which simulates the hardware using 16-bit binary instructions to control chips and data flow.

**Why It’s Educational**
RV-I’s simplicity (1-bit operations, few instructions) makes it ideal for learning how computers work at a fundamental level, like building blocks with NAND gates.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of RV-I as a 1-Bit Educational RISC-V-Like Computer

This section provides a comprehensive, professional analysis of RV-I, based on the provided attachment "rv-i]aug1.markdown" and the user’s clarification that RV-I is a 1-bit educational RISC-V-like computer. It expands on the direct answer, detailing the emulator’s design, implementation, and alignment with educational goals, ensuring a thorough understanding for comparison with the binary HDLb0 version.

#### Introduction
RV-I, as described in the attachment, is a custom, simplified processor inspired by RISC-V, designed for educational purposes with a focus on 1-bit operations. The user’s statement, “no, this is rv-i 1 bit educational riscv like computer,” aligns with the attachment’s description, confirming RV-I’s nature as a minimal, educational system running on the HDLb0 emulator. This analysis explores RV-I’s architecture, instruction set, and simulation environment, providing a basis for comparison with the HDLb0 binary implementation and supporting the user’s learning journey.

#### RV-I Architecture
RV-I is defined as a 1-bit version of a computer inspired by RV-II, with the following components:
- **Registers**: Four 1-bit registers, `r0, r1, r2, r3`, stored in RAM locations 0-3. Each register holds a single bit (0 or 1), simplifying operations for educational purposes.
- **Memory**: Sixteen 1-bit memory locations, `mem[0-15]`, stored in RAM locations 4-19. Each memory cell is 1-bit, allowing for basic data storage and retrieval.
- **Program Counter (PC)**: A 4-bit program counter, stored in RAM[20], used to track the current instruction. Given 16 memory locations for instructions, the 4-bit PC can address up to 16 positions, suggesting each instruction occupies one memory location, likely encoded in the HDLb0 emulator’s program file.

This 1-bit architecture is ideal for teaching fundamental computing concepts, such as logic gates, data movement, and control flow, at a granular level.

#### Instruction Set
RV-I supports four instructions, each designed for simplicity and educational value:
- **NAND**: A logic operation, e.g., `r1 = ~(r1 & r2)`. For 1-bit registers, this computes the NAND of two bits, a fundamental gate operation.
- **LOAD**: Copies a 1-bit value from memory to a register, e.g., `r1 = mem[0]`. This moves data from RAM[4-19] to RAM[0-3].
- **STORE**: Saves a register’s 1-bit value to memory, e.g., `mem[1] = r1`. This writes from RAM[0-3] to RAM[4-19].
- **JUMP**: Changes the PC based on a register value, e.g., `pc = r1 * 2`. This supports basic control flow, likely used for loops or branching, with the PC stored in RAM[20].

These instructions align with a minimal RISC-V-like ISA, focusing on computation (NAND), data movement (LOAD, STORE), and control (JUMP), suitable for educational exploration.

#### Simulation Environment
RV-I runs on the HDLb0 emulator (`0.hdlb0.☮️16]x7]PS.c`), which simulates the hardware using 16-bit binary instructions. The HDLb0 emulator:
- Parses program files like `adder-rvi.txt`, decoding each 16-bit instruction into four parts: chip_location, ram_output_address, input_a, input_b.
- Resolves inputs (0, 1, 5=switch_0, 6=switch_1, 7=clock, 2/3=blank, >15=RAM address).
- Executes instructions, calling chips (e.g., NAND) or performing pass-through operations, with outputs to RAM or tape.

The attachment confirms RV-I’s components are mapped to HDLb0’s RAM:
- Registers `r0-r3` in RAM[0-3].
- Memory `mem[0-15]` in RAM[4-19].
- PC in RAM[20].

This mapping allows RV-I to leverage HDLb0’s simulation capabilities, with 16-bit instructions encoding the RV-I operations.

#### Comparison with HDLb0 Binary Version
The user’s request for a pure GCC C version (arrays, no structs) for comparison suggests a desire to understand RV-I’s low-level implementation. The provided C emulator (`rv_i_emulator.c`) is a simplified RV32I-like processor, but for RV-I (1-bit), we need to adjust:
- **Registers**: Use `int8_t registers[4]` for 1-bit registers (0 or 1).
- **Memory**: Use `int8_t memory[16]` for 16 1-bit memory locations.
- **Instructions**: Implement NAND, LOAD, STORE, JUMP, matching RV-I’s ISA.

The C emulator below is tailored for RV-I, using arrays, and can be compared to HDLb0’s binary logic:
- HDLb0 uses 16-bit instructions to control chips; the C version executes RV-I instructions directly.
- HDLb0 maps registers to RAM[0-3]; the C version uses an array for registers.
- HDLb0 outputs to tape and RAM; the C version prints results for comparison.

#### Implementation
Below is the RV-I emulator in pure GCC C, using arrays, no structs, for educational comparison:

```x-c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

// Define constants for RV-I
#define NUM_REGS 4 // 4 1-bit registers (r0-r3)
#define MEM_SIZE 16 // 16 1-bit memory locations (mem[0-15])
#define PC_SIZE 4 // 4-bit program counter (0-15)

// CPU State: Arrays for registers, memory, and PC
int8_t registers[NUM_REGS]; // 1-bit registers (0 or 1)
int8_t memory[MEM_SIZE]; // 1-bit memory
int8_t pc = 0; // Program counter (4-bit, 0-15)

// Instruction format: Simple array for program (each instruction is 4 bytes for simplicity)
uint8_t program[] = {
    // Example program: NAND r1, r2 -> r1, then LOAD r1, mem[0]
    0x01, 0x01, 0x02, 0x00, // NAND r1, r2 -> r1 (opcode=1, rd=1, rs1=1, rs2=2)
    0x02, 0x01, 0x00, 0x04, // LOAD r1, mem[0] (opcode=2, rd=1, addr=4, unused=0)
    0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF // End marker
};

// Execute one instruction
void execute_instruction() {
    // Fetch instruction (first 4 bytes at pc)
    uint8_t opcode = program[pc];
    uint8_t rd = program[pc + 1];
    uint8_t rs1 = program[pc + 2];
    uint8_t rs2 = program[pc + 3];

    // Check for end marker
    if (opcode == 0xFF) {

            break;
        case 2: // LOAD: r[rd] = mem[rs1] (rs2 is address offset, here 4 for mem[0])
            registers[rd] = memory[rs1]; // Assuming rs1 is the memory address (0-15)
            printf("LOAD mem[%d] -> r%d = %d\n", rs1, rd, registers[rd]);
            break;
        case 3: // STORE: mem[rs1] = r[rd] (rs2 unused)
            memory[rs1] = registers[rd];
            printf("STORE r%d -> mem[%d] = %d\n", rd, rs1, memory[rs1]);
            break;
        case 4: // JUMP: pc = r[rs1] * 2 (simplified, assuming rs1 holds a valid PC)
            pc = (registers[rs1] * 2) & 0xF; // 4-bit PC, wrap around
            printf("JUMP to PC = %d\n", pc);
            return; // Don't increment PC, JUMP sets it
        default:
            printf("Unknown opcode: %d at PC=%d\n", opcode, pc);
    }
    pc += 4; // Move to next instruction (4 bytes)
}

int main() {
    // Initialize registers and memory
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_REGS; i++) {
        registers[i] = 0; // All registers start at 0
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < MEM_SIZE; i++) {
        memory[i] = 0; // All memory starts at 0
    }

    // Set initial values for demonstration
    registers[1] = 1; // r1 = 1
    registers[2] = 0; // r2 = 0
    memory[0] = 1; // mem[0] = 1 for LOAD test

    // Main execution loop
    printf("Starting RV-I Emulator...\n");
    while (pc < sizeof(program) && pc >= 0) {
        execute_instruction();
    }

    // Print final state
    printf("\nFinal State:\n");
    printf("Registers: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_REGS; i++) {
        printf("r%d=%d ", i, registers[i]);
    }
    printf("\nMemory: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < MEM_SIZE; i++) {
        printf("mem[%d]=%d ", i, memory[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
