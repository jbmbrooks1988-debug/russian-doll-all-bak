this is the best halo.c we have. 


it runs, it looks like original. etc. even if u reprompt or w/e u would use this = ☮️

(id rip out bank and only use nand but w/e 4 real tho. thats how netlist works, <-
however u may like it 4 quantum restrap... not that u couldn't put it back after... its a module w/e tho ) 

☯️
yea it may have some differences from old halo tho im sure it works better.]def ez'r read...= ez groxdox... 


run old halo and compare output if theres something u rather have, show grok output
im sure it can figure it out. 
🔘️
(even if u have to switch registers, i'd switch "HDLB0" 4 now, then swap back after]EZr ofc, duh

ofc it can rewrite itself in rv.s do rv-ii++ first tho ...

📬️
theres no modem , etc. build what u need when u need it imo. just make/ network rv-ii++ uart etc

🧰️tools 4 working with this? ie -> reverses chip digrams 2 "VHDL" (4 readability) & vice versa🧰️
i wanna push proof, we obviously have to make nand 2 tetris, 
and keep making helper tools along the way. 
🧩️
(cuz we need flip flops etc, and wayts 2  puzzle/snap/scratch them 2gether w/o tons of binary (4 grokmaybe)
