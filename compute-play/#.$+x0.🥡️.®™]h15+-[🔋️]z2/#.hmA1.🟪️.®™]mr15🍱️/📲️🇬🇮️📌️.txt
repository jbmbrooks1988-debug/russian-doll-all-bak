📹️ <- cam , where should it read from instead? 
literally "xyz" of "camera peice" 
(we link it 2 something else IN DATA)
(how are u moving it currently? )
(u can still use that as 'cam controls'
(peices can have 'dif controls') ; fix this first

(where is it reading from 2 change cam???)

?

the problem is theres stuff thats confusing u . 
and there trying 2 force me 2 explain 2 their egos @ same time/troll
w/e take a nap im not their fucking slave / clown

otherwise? 

could ask grok (im literally about 2 ); ask it "WHAT?"


🇬🇮️🇬🇮️🇬🇮️
instead of moving camera when cam_x cam_y & cam_y change, i just wanna move it when vanilla x,y,&or z change (were gonna use a more flexible architecture). what parts of this code do i have to change to do that?

just "lay down" <-w/e and restore health , while
stopping 'other functions' ie : not "working"? 

btw, for working, just go "place blocks" put it in game loop
make a "meta ai" thingi that can pick "place blocks" or "do nothing"
or "walk" dont just "walk" 

"but if "sleeping" stop this" 
"also make 'user stoppable 4 manual control'🧠️💪️🧠️


🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️🦳️
meta_ai_0.c <- can be many of these (can pass args or read from file)
