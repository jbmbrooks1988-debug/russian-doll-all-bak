🗓️u should use "turns passed" or user "pass turn entry thru menu"
2 pass turn <- user would be better, 
how do we feed tamo and pass turn, then we will run down hunger.

calendar in monopoly? yes... they're also doing monsterancher/pokemonarmies...
(and can 'sponsor' fights <- winning team gets more marketing views 4 ur ranch)


(SO THEY ARE ON DIFFERENT DAYS? 
no they all take a turn, they may be on autoturn tho.

whatabout slow players? (look ahead ai or live; can average results]ADVANCED)

what to build? just build monsterrancher. do battles against ai 
and then introduce monopoly turns. (the ai takes its turns when u do 
on the calendar

then we will "place houses/hotels"
(and later can do 'micro mineing/building/crafting/farminng/shooting)

wait what about "teaching monster from llm corpus, + tech tree;

user can use this 2 end turn. later they can set something 2 run THAT
2 automate turn . 

now we can cook. and take user input, even if its ai . 
we will setup automation .

try both 2 confirm realtime play

will just run a "menu" 
that reads from kvp_locations.txt 2 either show submenu or execute choice

(just change unicycle 2 read from locations instead of dir. w/e

if something is plugin vs 'piece'? hope its modular but
maybe determined by button/gameloop

📅️jul22-

the button can do w/e u want it 2 do. just start basic.

📼️
seems basic? boring .just do it. (can be a netlist or w/e) 
"the functions are 'in the loop?' uh... loop can call functions. i duno w/e figure it out.

<i may put ctrl/cam in button, and stomach/brain in loop , etc. otherwise wut? 
uh... it makes sense. 
🥴️
ECS doesn't really speak 2 user interface, but.. yea]MVC?

maybe cam and controller go in "loop" since they keep checking data ? 
🔘️
<cam needs 2 loop on its own, so its its own system.in a way; it will get started by button with loop.
so will the menu / u dont need a menu ; u can input in "gl" or "cli" 2 move...u reall dont need menu> 

🪜️
make button.c / .sh w/e <- c if u want to manage pid's (dont worry about 4 now , go fast), 
make it run list of executables. 
populate_supers.c <-optional w8 4 now
cam.c <- optional 

game_loop.c <- what does this run ? A: netlist; made on push? (now this is podracing) {

clock_inc.+x  <- just 1-10 incriment for now while testing basics

start_peices(start peices in netlist ; or all in ../; start? wuts start? they have loops ? ){

if they have loops, they dont run theyre own clock they run off a parent (if optional arg1?) <-BIG]NOW!?⁉️
🅰️this isn't loop for "land or something" its loop for "1 human" we can look at that after tho🅰️

ai.c <- moves peice independantly; per inc ([has its own netlist]can check board later)

read_input.c read new state; per inc 


health.c <- update health data based on w/e system ; data? can be "supered" into 'state.txt' or w/e ]FLEX
🤍️

done.c <- do w/e done means , ur done, move onto next thing. {more peices, place/pickup, motives, gravity}

im ignoring cam 4 now, but if i started a cam what should it read position of cam ? 1pov? 3rd? 
(ignore that and worry about buttons operating multi systems )
like... 1 button 4 1 person doesn't start "all ppl"(unless it does, but, u should put that button 
outside right? like in sword, or flexbox.; we will sort that out ez after a few are made <3=PUSH]PUSH

PUSH TO WU/WSR/CIV

🎮️🕹️🚥️
⬜️📌️

want this logic : 
if no state , so what , just means map cant move  

if no map , so what, just means render 1 block


if state but "no size/ position" 
w/e should be on map. 

adv : map has coords but so does state? override/overwrite map i guess. w/e <- yes. 

🔳️
ok. first thing. theres no super state. yes . make a button now <3

🎥️also. i think we put the camera plugin in "box" and just adjust paths. w/e ]+clean kruft.txt's🎥️

🗡️sword has its own menu. or is it box plugin again? wut gives u control of sword, 🖇️
literal login? but wut tho? = a plugin , right? 
a plugin from button box that adjusts sword position & dir could work, 
then u wouldnt need 2 touch sword directly , this maybe the common sense missing link 🖇️🗡️




but wut if i want to touch sword w/o login? 
first of all u cant, so.. (otherwise it would need 2 run button 4 cam, or symlink a cam @ this point)
(u use a "controller") ignore sword...more important is clock-link-updates]gameloop

🔲️
this may be the most important thing at this point. get it done fast pls🔲️

(pressing button can setup maps {&start clock/ai} w/o turning on a camera btw)

*original coords dont matter, but its not rocket science (we will have mc-biome/world gen later)

📬️
the problem im seeing is that "peices have camera coordinates"
really it should be 'what'? that person controlling should? u REALLY NEED TO BORE THRU THIS STUF
just 2 get us up and running enough 2 go 2 '2d'📬️
