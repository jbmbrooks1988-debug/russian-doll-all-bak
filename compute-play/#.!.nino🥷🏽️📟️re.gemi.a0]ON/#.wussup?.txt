i want to make an open gl game that uses the assets in this folder


=======================================================
i want to re-write this tile map editor in gcc pure c , opengl/ glut and stb headers. 



no new or custom headers, i rather use executable modules using system() or pipe

if they need to share data we want external .txt for better data visualization




 	

start will basic user editable functinality and tack on features module by module.
we can test step by step
rules : prefer arrays to structs for readability. no linking .c files. 
standalone modules only


dont try to test directly . instead :   
make a robust testing program that can test pass/fail each feature as u make it
script should also be in pure gcc c . same rules. (should read its commands
from a .txt file)
in c_rewrite/ directory

since this is working and ez. 
1. it could do entire rmmmv, if u got more down and dirty with arch spex...
1.it could also make webgl version but in memory

🔮️
also just cuz we made "vibe coded" doesn't mean gemini cant ez vibe orchbreak
into legit "peice-likes" , further so if we show it peice architecture.

honestly tho this is just like a "back up/ref for peices we have. w/e

💌️gonna get rmmv 2d/ cli renderer 2 remember, render it in ascii cli !
amd 3d option! 
(oh sure hook , rl // llm thru gemini if it does. wut else? money / trade
farming etc, GO GO GO !💌️

(we should be reading off rmmv sprite sheet, not this garbage, 
keep iterating. ; like i said , this is kinda "step backup prompting"

this goes fast cuz there is a visual/interactive test element, i guess
keep pushign (plus im at desktop desk)....


{who else is doing this? with my arch? w/e blah blah/ do our stuff. RB&U]SP5000}

its great, when it switches to other player turn , we are          │
│   going to impliment a "rl" finite state machine type ai, that       │
│   saves saves weights.<peice>.txt and biases.<peice>.txt so          │
│   that it can learn/ and be trained, user may update bias file       │
│   to try to enhance peice performance. get it  ? 


_________
before we go forward i have a minor data architecture edit that will be fun!
all the .png files should be in their own dir ie : <peice>.dir/ 

we can store and retreive all the information like that from now on. get it? 

instead of seperating by "class" it wil be more "gamified" each 
peices data can be in its own folder, thats fun for the user to view <3 
⚠️



ignore below ----
ask it to rewrite rmmv engine basics in gcc c ,
especially the data structures, and asset use


have it make an editor for it .

have it make a 3d editor (or just render in optional 3d )

what about tsots!? (this is for adaptability, may even help inform needed fx/data)⚠️


(ask gemini to read the rules of my_chara/bots / aow and make it in gl)
(describe mars merc/space invaders have it remade. 
have it make social in [web]gl, using pics on computer & put up on jbmbrooks
along with this rest of this, so we can 
"ALSO CLONE REDDIT< and put our stories on it ,etc.
