tabs in terminal!? (using tab command with terminal open obv uses terminal instead. etc) 


the more i mess with this it makes me wonder. am i just stupid as hell? {y do we go back and forth gl/or terminal}

why dont we just remake the terminal/linux_gui...😬️ in "gl"(other than emojis look ugly , ofc? ) 

real question is why haven't u made ur own kernel xv6linux like, with its own shit? ok, well we are tool-shipping. chill.🥶️
