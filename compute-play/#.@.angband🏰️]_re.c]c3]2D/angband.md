     1 # 🎮 Angband: The C & OpenGL Remake 🚀
     2 
     3 Welcome to the grand rewrite of Angband! This project is all about remaking the classic roguelike using
       pure C and OpenGL, following a unique, modular approach. Let's get this adventure started! ⚔️
     4 
     5 ## 📜 Guiding Principles (The Rules of the Forge)
     6 
     7 These are the sacred rules we'll follow on this quest:
     8 
     9 *   **💻 Language:** Pure C (GCC)
    10 *   **🎨 Graphics:** OpenGL / GLUT
    11 *   **📁 Directory:** All new code lives in `c_rewrite/`
    12 *   **🧩 Modularity:**
    13     *   No custom headers! 🤯
    14     *   We use standalone executable modules called with `system()` or `pipe()`.
    15     *   No linking `.c` files directly. Each module is its own hero!
    16 *   **💾 Data:** All data shared between modules will be in human-readable `.txt` files. Easy to see,
       easy to debug!
    17 *   **👣 Process:** We'll build this game one feature at a time, testing at every step.
    18 *   **🧬 Data Structures:** We'll prefer simple arrays over structs for maximum readability.

    22 ## 🗺️ The Grand Plan: Our Epic Journey
    23 
    24 Here is the map for our adventure, broken down into phases. Each phase is a milestone!
    25 
    26 ### Phase 0️⃣: ✨ The Forge - Laying the Foundation
    27 
    28 *   **Goal:** Get a basic window up and running.
    29 *   **Steps:**
    30     1.  Create the `c_rewrite/` directory.
    31     2.  Set up a `Makefile` for easy compilation.
    32     3.  Write `main.c` to initialize an OpenGL/GLUT window.
    33     4.  Create the main game loop.
    34 *   **✅ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    35     *   A black OpenGL window appears on screen.
    36     *   The program compiles without errors using `make`.
    37     *   The window can be closed without crashing.
    38 
    39 ### Phase 1️⃣: 🌍 World-Building - Creating the Dungeon
    40 
    41 *   **Goal:** Generate and display a game map.
    42 *   **Steps:**
    43     1.  Create a `generate_map` module that outputs a dungeon layout to `map.txt`.
    44     2.  Create a `render_map` module that reads `map.txt` and draws it on the screen.
    45     3.  `main.c` will call `system("./generate_map")` once, then call `render_map` in the game loop.
    46 *   **✅ KPIs:**
    47     *   A static dungeon map is visible in the window.
    48     *   `map.txt` exists and its contents are a clear representation of the map (e.g., using `#` for
       walls, `.` for floors).
    49 
    50 ### Phase 2️⃣: 🦸 The Hero's Arrival - Player Control
    51 
    52 *   **Goal:** Get the player character on screen and moving.
    53 *   **Steps:**
    54     1.  Create a `player_control` module to handle keyboard input.
    55     2.  This module will update the player's coordinates in `player_pos.txt`.
    56     3.  The main render loop will read `player_pos.txt` and draw the player character (`@`) at the
       correct location on the map.
    57     4.  Create `player_stats.txt` to hold character info (HP, etc.).
    58 *   **✅ KPIs:**
    59     *   The `@` symbol appears on the map.
    60     *   The player can move the `@` around the dungeon using arrow keys.
    61     *   Movement is constrained by walls.
    62     *   `player_pos.txt` and `player_stats.txt` are created and updated correctly.
    63 
    64 ### Phase 3️⃣: 👹 Enter the Goblins - Monsters & NPCs
    65 
    66 *   **Goal:** Populate the dungeon with creatures.
    67 *   **Steps:**
    68     1.  Create a `monster_data.txt` file defining different monster types (e.g., `goblin,g,10,1`).
    69     2.  Create a `spawn_monsters` module to place monsters in the dungeon, writing their positions to
       `monsters_pos.txt`.
    70     3.  Create a `monster_ai` module that updates `monsters_pos.txt` with new positions (e.g., random
       movement).
    71     4.  The main render loop will draw all monsters from `monsters_pos.txt`.
    72 *   **✅ KPIs:**
    73     *   Monster symbols (`g`, `o`, etc.) appear on the map.
    74     *   Monsters move around the dungeon each turn.
    75     *   `monsters_pos.txt` accurately reflects the positions of all monsters.
    76 
    77 ### Phase 4️⃣: ⚔️ The Clash of Steel - Combat & Items
    78 
    79 *   **Goal:** Implement combat and item interaction.
    80 *   **Steps:**
    81     1.  Update the `player_control` module to handle attack commands.
    82     2.  Create a `combat_resolver` module. When the player attacks, this module reads
       `player_stats.txt` and `monsters_pos.txt`, calculates damage, and updates the files.
    83     3.  Implement item pickups, storing them in `inventory.txt`.
    84     4.  Create `items.txt` to define all possible items in the game.
    85 *   **✅ KPIs:**
    86     *   Player can attack monsters, and monsters can be defeated.
    87     *   Player's HP decreases when attacked by a monster.
    88     *   Player can pick up items from the floor.
    89     *   `inventory.txt` shows the player's items.
    90 
    91 ### Phase 5️⃣: 📊 The Heads-Up Display (HUD)
    92 
    93 *   **Goal:** Display vital player information on screen.
    94 *   **Steps:**
    95     1.  Create a `render_hud` module.
    96     2.  This module reads `player_stats.txt` and `inventory.txt`.
    97     3.  It displays HP, gold, inventory, and other stats on the screen, separate from the map view.
    98 *   **✅ KPIs:**
    99     *   A HUD is clearly visible.
   100     *   The HUD updates in real-time as player stats change (e.g., taking damage).
