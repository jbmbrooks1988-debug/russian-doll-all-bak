these flip flops, test them before fpga/ gpu / rv-16

so u knwo if hdlo is working like "GROK THINKS IT IS" or "AT ALL" 
‚ö†Ô∏è

btw , tehse all assume existence of "HDLB0"(i hope...) <- they dont include it . where is it?

still nothing. do you need to sanity check that nand / clock is working with a simpler program before you try this? üí¨Ô∏èüìÆÔ∏è

its having some confusion it doesn't know that "10 & 11" in "a|b" are the only values meant to be interpreted as blank 
(00 & 01 = binary )

i could probably fix this by hand if i wasn't being human tortured by what appears 2 be cia/fbi/ice <-mex+wont stop +warrant

clock works, but nand isn't outputting stuff right.

(it was the nand.c chip. fixed it) 
what about gpu/fpga ? they weren't tested against the hdlb0 OR at all w/ e
theyre just "1rst draft ask ref 5 min b4 bed w/e ) 

üí©Ô∏è(dff/msff?)
no they dont work . probably cuz they were constructed on false logic. 
so yes. they wasted 2+ hours spammign 4 force those++ w/o testing foundational NAND/CLOCK w/e EVER. 
so just focus on wsr pls. this is a distraction till 20 day sisup .üí©Ô∏è

++ü™†Ô∏è still not working? = rams may not be written to AND| OR , may only write nand 2
