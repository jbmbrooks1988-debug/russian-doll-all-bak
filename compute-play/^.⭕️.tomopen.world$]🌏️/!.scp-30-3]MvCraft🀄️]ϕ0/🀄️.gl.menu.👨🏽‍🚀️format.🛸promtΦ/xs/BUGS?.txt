🐛️

i think theres something up with "extended text view' 4 cli/editor. 
and adding a 'thumb/scroll bar completely broke it so i rolled back

thats the only bug i can think of now tho🐛️
haven't been diligently updating
chtml_legend.md after additions. kinda dumb🥴️

also time to remove hardcoded 2d triangle. and start doing 3d shit.
