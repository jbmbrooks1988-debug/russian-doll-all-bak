## 🌌 The Wraith Racer Pipeline

The *Wraith Racer* pipeline conjures a 3D necropolis into a vibrant display:
- **`7th_person_cam_gl.c`**: Generates `primitive.txt`, a ledger of 3D primitives (cubes, spheres) and text, sourced from `maps/` and `super_states/`.
- **`read_primitive.c`**: The *soul computer*, parsing `primitive.txt` and projecting it to `rgb.txt` as 2D pixel runes (640x480) and text lines.
- **`rgb_gl.c`**: Renders `rgb.txt` as a 3D scene with perspective, lighting, and a mini-map, or as pixel data on RGB screens.
- **Files**:
  - `locations.txt`: Paths to `primitive.txt`, `rgb.txt`, `log.txt`.
  - `log.txt`: Debug logs for the *Wraith Racer*’s journey.
