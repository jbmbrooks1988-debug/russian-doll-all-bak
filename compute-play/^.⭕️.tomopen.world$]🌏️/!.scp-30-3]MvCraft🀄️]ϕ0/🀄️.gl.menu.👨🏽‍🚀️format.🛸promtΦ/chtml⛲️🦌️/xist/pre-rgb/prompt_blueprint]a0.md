{ppost? reprompt from scratch . read maps . just do rmmvc peice by peice, 
however having stuff for this game acutally doesnt hurt esp with a 3d switch . 
then u can do ur mc and add rmmvc

if i do fork 2 hardcode game in "empty model.c instead"
then it would be an 'informed fork'(it is pretty weird that  model is empty...

i kinda feel like we should have game related data...
including abilities 2 load maps and peices...since all games do that, but 
w/e 
<view could communicate 2 model for changing vars , even thru a piped
game module manipulating primatives and could be player.c ; ofc
that means current module system is 'flawed' it was always weird...
'it was ill thought out and hap hazard tbh>

just read over the code more or dont expect it 2 go 'ur way'
👨🏽‍🚀️
i may explain it my goals and ask about the arch"
i assume module.+x isn't doing much so i may just nuke it and ask from 
that pov + data is supposed to be handled in model.c i know that. 
so it needn't "leave mem' save for sub pipe for w/e game its launching, 
but this is more informed and aware than before.

tldr : prompt better but use this foundation 'if u want' it has plenty going for it otherwise. 


also still dont know how update is working (probably csv)
doesn't have to be tho, could be pipe.
👨🏽‍🚀️

💬️ read over 
1.model 2.view 3.controller and module/model.game 
this is chtml. current its good at rendering .chtml but has no code for logic/dataflow model.c will contain some boiler plate primatives then run apps as "binaries" using pipe() to send and take data from binary passed as arg2  ;

(currently it as a system to run modules/<name>.c as arg to and read write data using
io.csv's but that was poorly architected. 
in step1 we want to remove that old functionality. 
.
the functionality will be simliar but will run module/<name>.c
inside model.c and read(game logic) and write(controler input) to it via pipes

in model.c we are going to define primatives that a game may contain. 
that need to be communicated to view , or chtml elements
such as pixels,circles,squares, spheres, cubes , colors,xyz&alpha (for maps)
 
 and 'peices' + their corresponding stats, for the data io. 
 (peices may be associated with shape and color, 
 but some map elements dont have to have 'stats or can share stats
 as 'copies' 
 
 etc (
remove the reading from external .csv  .
any data in put will be done inside model.c 

we will make a basic game of player(controlled by arrows) and obstacles 
(that has chtml buttons 2d/3d to toggle back and forth

remove the old code, test compile, save as zip tar in back/, and then make a blueprint_mvc+.md for the new architecture
before we beging coding 

i will run a post compile test to make sure 
all other chtml functions in /chtml/demo.chtml]c4]PURE.txt
still work besides the ones that are module related
(ie text input, buttons, element colors, submenu's etc)

I understand now! You want to keep the primitives in the model (for
  rendering purposes) but have the actual game logic run inside
  module/<name>.c, which can read map and state data from its own CSV
  files. The game module should specify collision behavior. Let me adjust
  the architecture:

   1. The model will define primitive types and rendering primitives
   2. The actual game logic runs in module/<name>.c
   3. The module can communicate with the model via pipes or function
      calls
   4. The module can read its own map/state CSV data

  Let me update the model.c to focus on the primitive system while
  allowing the module to specify collision behavior:

}r implementing the Bomberman game, but requires a few key enhancements, primarily the addition of a game loop timer and improved game state serialization. The module system is well-suited for the game logic, and the canvas rendering system can be extended to handle the visual requirements of the game.

The architecture will follow the existing MVC pattern while extending it with game-specific functionality. The module system allows for clear separation of game logic from UI rendering, which aligns well with the original Bomberman code structure.
