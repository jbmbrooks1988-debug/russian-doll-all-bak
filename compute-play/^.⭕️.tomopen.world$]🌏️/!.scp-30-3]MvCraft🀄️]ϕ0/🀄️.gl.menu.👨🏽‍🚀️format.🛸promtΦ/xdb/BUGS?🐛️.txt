🐛️

i think theres something up with "extended text view' 4 cli/editor. 
and adding a 'thumb/scroll bar completely broke it so i rolled back

thats the only bug i can think of now tho🐛️
haven't been diligently updating
chtml_legend.md after additions. kinda dumb🥴️

also time to remove hardcoded 2d triangle. and start doing 3d shit.
🔑️
btw . u only need 1 module arg (that module orchs "SUB MODULES"tho, get it?

maybe totally chill 2 switch between multiple .chtml's tho
(completely like any website)
at which point u may want to hot load a new module . w/e why not. arg4setuponli
