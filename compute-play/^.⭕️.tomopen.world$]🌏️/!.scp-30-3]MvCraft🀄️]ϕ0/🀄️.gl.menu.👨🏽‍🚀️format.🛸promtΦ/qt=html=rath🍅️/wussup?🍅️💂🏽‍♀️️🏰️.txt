⚠️there is no 'qt' for .c , only c++ 🥴️ignore qt conventions😜️⚠️
choking a bit on limits of rmmv prompting
but even more. we rather have std... and we can . html/gl...
💬️
lets make an html renderer for gl. 
we can start small with basics...


all we really need to do is figure out how to show mini windows .
{for nested menu's}
how does html do this? 

everything else is ez

<what about variables? read them from .txt kvp

    <p id="message"></p>
    <script>
      let userName = "Alice";
      document.getElementById("message").textContent = "Hello, " + userName + "!";
    </script>

if u wish 2 get farther with gl windows. 

u should just make a html render. 


we can do buttons/windows/w/e and "canvas (2d&3d) "

u will spend more time on canvas 
but its still a renderer. and u focus on that ie



main.c 
view.c = "html.c" "canvas.c" <- both can write 2 ".txt" 2 share
model.c = need? 
controller.c = input ? 


remake rmmv in htgl using old 4 reference

u should only use external data files . then 
its more compact. gemini can do this. its worth it 4 more gl progs
including a browser , lol ;) 

dont try 2 force mvc. try 2 force reading from .txt ie wraith. 
good we can use that for rv-ii
wanna do rv-ii now so we can know how 2 hook up ? sure w/e
we have lots of XP, im not worried about it. 

so htgl , can dump 2 "RATH" and back. (pixels/rgb)
this is good...
so was rv-ii (we pushed untested so effed it up a bit but were gud now)

i may (just for this obv, cuz gl ) 
use headers "intentionally"

so =

main.c
view.c : html.c html.h 
controller.c : html.h controller.h 
model.c : .h ? + "includes.c" <- would be js? 

🪡️maybe not this EXACTLY but something like this "intentionally'
ie not 'haphazrdly up 2 the llm...
🪡️🔑️gfto out of 'gl'context and back into data asap
then we can run threaded .c programs that just write 2 data.
and the html.mvc can just read from our "database.txt" like sql.

its already gonna read 'index.html' etc...


the real problem is "canvas"
cuz theoretically u could render html in canvas ,get me? 

ofc u want to beable 2 recursively do w/e u want in ur system
even if u dont actualy do it...

its def not some smol job tho.

but if u think of the rmmv menu
(its not for a unreal liek game engine)
its just "character menu + save load ; ie its cheat...


but ur going ointo "google/firefox/msft" level terrirtory. 
its kinda crazy but w/e , wehave llm...and its 2 "fix gl"
its such a gnarly hardcore fucked up abstract thing +retention...
that only a super established company would bother doing it...
but ai... 


w/e we will do stuff and see how it turns out, cuz we
have to have a "DYNAMIC" menu system ; and one day we will need browser so w/e . faster 🐈️
think of the moat...
if u can do retention youll beable 2 buy a castle lol🏰️
if not. well u have other problems anyways. 💂🏽‍♀️️
put it on github w/e lol. 
its not like others can do this w/o it. or will no 2use this w/e💂🏽‍♀️️

all u would need then is a js engine
(even tho were gunna run .c thru 4 now. good scaffold tbh 🚧️

🧚‍♀️️
do we finish rmmv 2 the point of a basic event? maybe w/e 
y bother? 


remember we also have a "tiny rmmv" w/e lol well see.


we abandon projects all the time 2 get 2 deepr control...
at least we can ref them now
🧚‍♀️️
just do it 4 the infra. ; get it over with; we'll use it; they love graphix n shit & i need scale/speed. its aok . itll be done fast and scale fast. (if ur willing 2 spend 20 days doing shit youll be aight)🍒️🀄️



🤯️
the crazy part tho is we really only have to do the html render
(we dont really have to do it now...)
and they cuz we already kinda have a scheme 4 3d events right

(simple voxel + events, but we can build on that...) 

so im not sure maybe we wait and try 2 get a bit farther with RMMVC..4 now just 2 see wut we really req/vs have done../


do , do rv-ii but maybe it can wait, right? just keep pushign rmmvc
but u have this here....; its not that cut and dry 

what MADE u come here? just curiosity or a real problem? 
keep pushing (rmmvc) 4 now . 

im not lazy by any means (i made halo...), be strategic...

🎣️🔍️🧐️
its not that it does't need 2 be done
and we tried b4 , with a simple csv type format but it broke everyting
so... we will push 4 scaff/ref but may try 
"within games or something, get it? with smoller simpler menu
schemes w/e" 🔍️🧐️
🤯️
