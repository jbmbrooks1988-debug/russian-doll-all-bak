It's definitely bad economics. But humans are just interested in more than maximum production and allocation efficiency. It's especially hard to sympathize when you're not the one directly benefitting from increased automation... Just like now

it would be like
listenening to someone who only spoke spanish
speaking english 2 u
or chinese
u wouldn't be mad at them perse
but theres no way ur gonn ahave a meaningful convo
u may resent them for not learning the language
or even making an effort after a while
just cuz u watch anime in japanese
doesn't mean u speak japanese
watching a japanese person watch anime
doesn't teach u japanese either
