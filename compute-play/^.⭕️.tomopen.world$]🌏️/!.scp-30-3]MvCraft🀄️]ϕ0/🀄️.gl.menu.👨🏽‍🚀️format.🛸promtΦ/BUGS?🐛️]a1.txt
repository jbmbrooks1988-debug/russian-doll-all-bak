❤️‍🩹️ if u ever have problems with a features of <htmvc> u can always just
remove it and try 2 make it seperatly as ref or start over w/e 
as opposed 2 it being in some big scary project + u get a whole bunch of modular space for free thru "modules" (and can seperate view.c and canvas.c one day if u like ]u did good <3❤️‍🩹️


📮️🪲️post refactor to model.c  = everything is better than before
cept dir/ stuff ; i have to press enter in cli 2 get it 2 register click. 
wtf🪲️📮️
🐛️


i think theres something up with "extended text view' 4 cli/editor. 
and adding a 'thumb/scroll bar completely broke it so i rolled back

thats the only bug i can think of now tho🐛️
haven't been diligently updating
chtml_legend.md after additions. kinda dumb🥴️

also time to remove hardcoded 2d triangle. and start doing 3d shit.
🥴️
📊️🪞️
get rid of ALL the hardcoding and make an ASCII VERSION *y? cuz reuse. ++📊️🪞️
