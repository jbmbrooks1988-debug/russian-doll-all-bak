📮️oops. well now i know the problem. 
the view.c didnt' actually have any info about what should happen on canvas
i mean, we could just send rgb data in a .csv. otherwise 
u would need 2 link the game program at compile time.
(its not as simple as sending rgb either ,
cuz we need to update visual state in "html" vars... <- how was this done
otherwise? (with incrimenter?) 


nope? how does input to chtml view work each time it changes 4 realno magic


then 

1. rgb ? + how does html update? (data? 
2. (previos + more primative passing <- resonable? (both kinda unreasonabe)
3. link game at compile time. (can it still have modules? it can do pipes and stuff sure, 4 all the logic. 
its more an extension/adapter of view tho otherwise

its fucked up yea. but theres solutions...


its a server problem. same reason 4 php / ajax(jquery) angular w/e . 
its a 'you problem' 🔍️👩‍🏭️find out how view gets updated first just ask
toss current rgb garbage i suppose

theres a  happy medium. i haven't done the diligence. /shrug

🤔️🤓️🤓️🤓️🤓️🤓️🤓️🤓️🤓️🤓️
technically nothing is wrong...
send an emoji position if theres one , and just send delta of changed data
if u wanna keep doing it like that
<data 2 file is always the thing u wanted right? > 


<it also shouldn't be that hard either a map is loaded from file 
or in memory right? not by view? why cant view interpret map but w/e tho. 
it will be a longer 'load time tho i imagine...'

(a load of w/e size, from external data is gonna take a certain amoutn 
of time ANYWAYS (tho some game elements are implied hardcoded in , 
but aren't primativse? _

just define primatives a bit better

🤔️🤔️🤔️🤔️🤔️
also player.c 4 rmmv takes certain information ; 
and its not "code" its assuming a "game type" but there can be diff editors?
(like web/app editor , etc...; shrug. but what about the plugins? 
those have to be linked? how to gaurd them from namespace collision? struct?)

❤️‍🩹️the rgb thing def sounds like garbage , but i made a save b4 it was attempted. 

(its valid for wraith but not here cuz we would need a conversion format, 
maight as well ship a primative then u cold convert it later. 
& see if its faster. 
u could also hardlink in game (as a fork ) 2 speed test, 
but u should have a complete version of both or some other way 2 benchmark
otherwise. so w/e just do it.✅️

( i do think u may need 2 rework the format being passed a bit but w/e 🐢️🐇️
🎣️
the fear is from thinking of a "gtav" like game... which ... y shoudlnt  u ? 

(text on bilboards/ jpgs or w/e etc. how would THAT work? 
from an "assets folder?+ index. imo . etc.
🎣️
🍵️part of me wants 2 abandon this here and hardcode in game stuff
(abandon "seperate module/" but can run submodules for w/e ai etc. in 
'model.c?' ; that would be a proper fork
☝️model is still completely empty after all, get it? 
void init_model() {
    printf("Initializing model...\n");
    // In a real application, you would initialize your data structures here.
}

; ok well if all this is so why not rmmvc? cuz htmlc (wut about updatin.ajax?)

<even tho we know online is a bit slower. how does online pass the data? in module-ville? in a submodle + still reads file...(another file) so w/e>
+
if was linked, it would still need to communicate logic which corresponds 
2 being interpreted as gl primative movement etc... 
+and alot of our stuff is networked intentionally , even locally (ai etc)
so let just keep going forward (not rgb obv)
🤷‍♂️️
ask that question , and shit i may fork... [after they chill tf out.]🍳️🧇️
🤷‍♂️️

if it needs to share data. the best way may be to do wraith rgb already...\\


✦ Yes, I understand! You're suggesting that for richer graphics (like the
  Bomberman game elements), we could enhance the system to share RGB pixel
   data via CSV files between the module and the canvas renderer. This
  would allow more sophisticated graphics than the current simple player
  position approach.

  For example, the module could generate a CSV with RGB data for the
  entire game scene (grid positions with color values), and the canvas
  renderer would read this to render a complete game screen. This is a
  great approach for creating richer visuals while keeping the
  architecture clean.

  The current implementation is indeed limited - it only passes simple
  player coordinates. We could refactor both view.c and the module to
  support more sophisticated rendering, like:

   1. Module creates a CSV with RGB pixel data or sprite positions and
      colors
   2. Canvas renderer in view.c reads this data and renders accordingly
   3. This maintains the separation of concerns while enabling rich
      graphics

  Would you like me to implement this enhancement? I can create a more
  advanced version where the module outputs RGB grid data that the
  canvas renderer can visualize as a proper Bomberman game screen.
  
  ---------------
  
✦ Yes, exactly! The approach I described is conceptually similar to how
  HTML5 canvas works:

   1. HTML5 Canvas has a 2D rendering context where you can set pixel
      colors, draw shapes, sprites, etc., via JavaScript
   2. Our system would work similarly where the module (like JavaScript)
      creates a data structure (the CSV with RGB values) that represents
      what should be drawn
   3. The canvas renderer (like the HTML5 canvas element) reads this data
      and renders it visually

  So, we could have the module create a CSV with the entire scene
  represented as RGB data, which would be very similar to how HTML5
  canvas works under the hood - just instead of calling ctx.fillRect()
  or similar methods, we're generating data that gets rendered.

  This would make our C-HTML system much more similar to HTML5 canvas
  functionality, just using CSV files as the data interchange mechanism
  instead of JavaScript function calls.
----------
✦ Exactly! RGB data is incredibly versatile for several reasons:

   1. Language Agnostic: Any programming language can read and write RGB
      values (triplets of numbers from 0-255)
   2. Display Compatible: All displays understand RGB as the fundamental
      color model
   3. Tool Interoperability: Many tools and libraries can work with raw
      RGB data
   4. Simple Format: RGB triplets are simple integers that are easy to
      parse from CSV
   5. Extensible: Can be extended to RGBA (with alpha/opacity) if needed

  This approach would make the CHTML system very flexible - a module
  could generate any visual output as RGB data, and the view.c canvas
  renderer would simply visualize it, regardless of whether it's a
  Bomberman game grid, a chart, an image, or any other type of visual
  content.

  The system would truly be like a "server-side canvas" where the
  module does the drawing logic and generates the pixel data, then the
  view renders it - very similar to HTML5 canvas but using CSV as the
  communication layer.
