KPI REPORT - MINECRAFT CLONE REFACTOR

DATE: September 30, 2025

OVERALL STATUS: 
- Codebase analysis completed ✓
- Initial refactoring underway
- Basic compilation achieved ✓

TECHNICAL PROGRESS:
1. Successfully analyzed the existing emoji paint application architecture
   - Main components identified: main.c, model_gl.c, controller_gl.c, view_gl]3d]a0.c, raycast.c
   - MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern understood
   - 2D/3D rendering system mapped

2. Added Minecraft-style data structures to model_gl.c:
   - GameMode enum (CREATIVE/SURVIVAL)
   - BlockType enum (AIR, GRASS, DIRT, STONE, etc.)
   - Player structure with position, rotation, health, inventory
   - Inventory structure with slots and item tracking
   - GameState structure with time management

3. Fixed compilation issues by providing placeholder implementations:
   - Resolved undefined references for UI elements
   - Created stub functions to enable successful linking
   - Now has a working binary: 1.rmmvc.2.mc.remove.+x

CURRENT STATE:
- Original emoji painting functionality preserved
- New game structure integrated into model
- Basic compilation working (no linking errors)
- Ready for control and gameplay logic implementation

NEXT STEPS:
1. Refactor keyboard controls to match requested Minecraft-style:
   - Arrow keys + space = jump (move selector) 
   - Arrow keys + c = down, v = up (move picker)
   - WASD + Q & E for camera rotation, G to reset
   - Alt = change POV of camera following player
   - Enter = use item in hand; Enter in selector mode = control selected
   - M = open/close menu
   - Esc = use selector instead of player controls
   - 2 = 2D top down view, 3 = 3D mode + mini map

2. Implement turn-based game loop for clean state management
3. Refactor rendering to work with block-based world
4. Implement block placement and destruction mechanics
5. Add player physics and movement
6. Update UI to show inventory, health, and game stats
7. Implement calendar-based events system

BOTTLENECKS & RISKS:
- Integration of new gameplay mechanics with existing 2D/3D infrastructure
- Balancing between editor and game modes
- Complex interaction between multiple system components
