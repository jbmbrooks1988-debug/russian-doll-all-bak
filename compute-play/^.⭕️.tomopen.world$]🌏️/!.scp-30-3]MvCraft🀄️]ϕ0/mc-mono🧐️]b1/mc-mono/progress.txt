# Mojicraft - Minecraft Clone Progress Report

## Current Implementation (Completed)

### Core Features:
- ✅ Voxel world generation (spherical world made of cubes)
- ✅ Biome generation system (plains, forest, desert, tundra, mountains, ocean)
- ✅ Player starting position on solid surface (not floating)
- ✅ Movement controls:
  - Arrow keys: Move selector 
  - WASD: Move camera
  - Q & E: Rotate head left/right
  - G: Reset camera
  - Space: Jump
  - C: Move picker down, V: Move picker up
- ✅ Minimap with player position and coordinates
- ✅ Physics system with gravity and collision detection
- ✅ Block type system (loaded from block_types.csv)
- ✅ MVC architecture
- ✅ Event loop system
- ✅ Basic rendering of voxel world
- ✅ Player representation in world

### Technical Implementation:
- ✅ OpenGL/GLUT graphics rendering
- ✅ C programming with GCC
- ✅ CSV parsing for block types
- ✅ Chunk-based world storage
- ✅ Proper collision detection preventing falling through ground
- ✅ Spherical world geometry

## Architecture Notes
- Components follow MVC pattern
- Event-based system for loose coupling
- Behavior trees for AI (foundation implemented)
- Lookup tables for performance (block types, etc.)
- Scalable chunk system for larger worlds
- Modular design allowing for easy feature additions
