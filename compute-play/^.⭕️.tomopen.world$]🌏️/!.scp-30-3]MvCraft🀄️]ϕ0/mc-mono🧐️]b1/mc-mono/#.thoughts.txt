# Mojicraft - Minecraft Clone Progress Report

what makes this better than "peices"<- compact easy 2 iterate on theoretically . altho peices really isn't that bad , i
think u mean large chunks, with a different "focus" (and can reverse engineer other things exactly the same later, but 
maybe thru a plugin system or something hopefully (could at least break that. anyways try diff ones, see which suits u , when for what
we have them all); but i think theres lots of value in having this as a plugin system, hopefully compatible with rmmvc, 
but whwere we can keep adding real minecraft like / 3d like features.
