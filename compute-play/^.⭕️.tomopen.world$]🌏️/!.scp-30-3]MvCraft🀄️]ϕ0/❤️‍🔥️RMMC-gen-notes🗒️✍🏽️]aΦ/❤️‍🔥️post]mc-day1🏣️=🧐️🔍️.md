should have used 3d shooter 2 just keep making details (doom copy or w/e + cars / planes/planet) and then added crafting later.

maybe should have done mario galazy but w/e do it later use 3d shooter foundation and make doom, the rest are trash.
rmmv is kinda interesting but ... i duno. 

<<< i actually got one that works mc-mono , but doen't mean u still cant clone doom 4 science. 
at some point ur gonna stop doing it and start reusing w/e ur comfy with for w/e project, ya kno? 
+ more projects means more of a need 4 a "platformiztion" solutino <3 ] LUX
! < we actually started this project with a specific set of reqs , (like text/2d/3d switching using numpad. so now is the time 2 add those on foundation!>
<cuz i got mono from ditch requs for a tight smol starter project. i guess this is it then.

<addition of selector btw, should instantly turn this into space flite
(i have a feelings u will fork this foundation a few times...


also a thing u would find very helpful if u move all menu coords functions or w/e into ".csv" and even use html or w/e html-like
maybe better 2 do it in a "sandbox" than 2 do it to rmmvc. which can be crazy . adding weird stuff 2 that ur not sure off...
code gets 2 precious even if its "ez 2 mod"; we dont want that. we want "TRUE MODULARITY" wherever we can have it
is menu really  a pain point 4 speed? or is it data structs ? w/e u will see, maybe its just macro preciousness. w/e 

(from rmmvc to daw 2 mc , i do feel like i 'git gud' at making these thingies so thats good. (real useable workable 3d 'engines/enviornments')
-------------------------

{dont forget , we want 'piece banks ' vs peices. dont deviat
2 far from are peice plan, this should support it ; (u cant btw ;) <3;
its basicallly the halo of sim/game data strux}⭕️


<also why not make rmmvc , but in MINECRAFT 
(even put the same menu's back and stuff, get it?
they can use picker as creative or do it all with player!>🤯️

(and its still tactical and multiplery ie = super fun + fortnite
but u can make maps , teleports , moree= enemies vs etc get it/ ?🤯️
(can make ai fighter armies do stuff based on jobs etc 
or try 2 do it all urself with 'selector'⚔️
(if ai has control of rmmv 'editor menu's' it can literal make games❗️
<and works in 1d & 2d. ➿️
will try 2 be concious of the fact that the whole thing should be
recursive player.c as well so editor is editable , get it? 
(dont sweat it tho, u will get thiere , this is epic!➿️

🧚‍♂️️u may even wanna just use the "re-rmmvc"knowing this...


*why would u do "all that work" 

(other than 2 make it recursive modular? 
u may think it prompts fast (or not ) but wil 'slow 2 norm' anyways so w/e
maybe at that time u will have the sense 2 refactor into 
external .csv 4 more things.]

but i understsand if ur doing it 4 fun...⛽️🌝️🗻️
after all it gives us great ideas , 
(not that we couldn't have done this later, 
ofc its easier the more modular this is so they real key is 
breaking it up into w/e rmmv / script/ event or w/e 🔑️
(this is a good breakthru but u woulda got there anyways
at least u have ur eyes on some cool gaol...🙄️

👨🏽‍🚀️ (this is a very good fund sounding idea. u want it 2 be real? stop now😬️bb-b-but we will forget idea!. cherish it like code🤷🏽‍♂️️

(the idea is minecraft IMMEDIATAELY in RMMV (using optional menus)+cli
how else were u gonna do the optional menus / cli 
🛸️
only 1 thing makes sense but its a good think 👨🏽‍🚀️


specify a menu format . with pointers to other menus (in menu or macro]both


and then it can work with 0.gl/1.wraith/ and 2.frame_buffer <-emulated. 
😇️🥳️
{we can single out fb emulator ;or do it with rv fast. y not!? fun!
this would make halo recurse thru horn, and we may start getting a single mono bild, and if we pullup riscv on x86 we coud ship a kernel , if we can run c compiler, we may have time after this and tight proximinty synergy}
😇️🥳️

u can do headers, footers, side bars, popups + even "CLI" <-peice♟️
and 'canvas' with all ur projtect in mind  ;
u could build out mc prototype out more but dont need 2 
ur gonna slow. 

+ "forum style stuff" + thumbs , etc (also browser)
wuts the "WSR SECREAT"? its that the menus should also work in "ASCII"🀄️
🀄️= halo and horn recursive  = Φ🪐️
🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️🛫️
if u do this u will NEVER SLOW
(and prompting it will go fast. its a win win win (win?)🛸️🏁️
🔍️THIS! is the "monofocal"🧐️ put everythig u got into it🔍️
