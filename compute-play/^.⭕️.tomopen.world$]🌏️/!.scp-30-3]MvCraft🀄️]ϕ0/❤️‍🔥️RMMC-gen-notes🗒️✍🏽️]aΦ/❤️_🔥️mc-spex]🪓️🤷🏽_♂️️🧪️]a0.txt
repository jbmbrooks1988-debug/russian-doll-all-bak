(how could it hurt 2 have a 'versatile 3d game (2d or 3d realtime/tactics
single player/ multi + ai or df ai management screens etc
depending on mode. for labbing. data prep , etc. 
+ adding scripting in tegrating tight ai into event loop etc
🪓️
use z levels and seperate data sheet for maps. +2d-view swap & rougelike
aim 2 backwards compat with peices/rmmv, this is just a lab.

>event loop etc

<honestly we want to make a "tactics" version of minecraft in 3d /2d
that shows availiable move space
(no we want o beable 2 switch between real time or tactics.
and still allow multiparty management. + ai builds mvp fast so lets go

(we can work out a plugin system, and use rmmv plugs (may use as player)
<and gives us versatility (ie unity/vs unreal compat/xchange rate)
(we can de construct etc
>>ill probably have diff forks of this

(and somehow later impose login screen + profile pre game start
(ie 'app starter screen'🪓️

🪵️
honestlly this is a better place long term 2 drop in chemi
visualization etc. cuz u should have commited 2 this codebase
and have ways where u have figured out how to "data orb-break"
out important micro-macro mechanical blox...
rmmvc is good 2 we want compatibility this isn't a competition its code..
< should all be used as tools to give us speed/ synergy +fun etc>]STOKED
🪵️

(i want emoji 2 look 3d from all sides <- llm-vis does this
we can do this for items. + we have an image voxelizer
+ we can fractal break things up.


can we use chinese or emojis but have text at bottom on hover?

I Remade Final Fantasy Tactics In Godot
📼️
(dont forget chrono cross elements and field effects!) 
intermediary mex make play fun, and teach u 2 modularly swap out 
differetn forx / xp riments...🍴️🫕️now were cooking 4 real 🫕️



🐡️
b-b-but what about fully recurse fvlly swapple fx liek 
'forum social IN MC' we will do taht with plugins etc later 
(we are doing scripting/plugins) but its nice 2 have 'lab-kit'🐡️


🪞️

minecraft simliarities 
(just make minecraft clone first) + mvc asap

(make mini map etc) 
(menus, w/e ) 

but when i press space bar, i want selector to move as player and let 
me select->'enter' other 'entities' to control with controls
selector can also place blocks like minecraft creative mode. 
selector will have 'controlled entities in its menu' and can select from.


THEN we can add 2d tab. (and text control .mud tab)
(this can rev ngn into rmmv) 
🪞️
can then use rmmv save project styles or use a converter w/e 
+ see what we "really want/need"




✡️
want to make a minecraft clone in gcc gl/glut and freetype
voxels are obviosly cubes; (can read them from block_types.csv)
(which should store each block type and how to render its pixels make up)

items should render as emojis 

players/creatures/enemies will render as 1 voxel for head and smaller partial voxels
to create rectangle arms and body (ie floating point positions 4 animation)which will be stored in .csv files with color/size/position/etc

emoji caching & always facing player 
picking with mouse or selector

move selector with arrow keys + space = jump 
move picker with arrow keeys + c = down v = up 
move camera with wasd + q & e for rotate head left and right + g reset

alt = change pov of camera following player
enter = use item in hand  ; enter in selector mode = control selected
(when controlling selected we see 'object inventory / stats & control it)
m = open/close menu  ( arrow or mouse for menu controls)
esc = use selector instead of player controls 
2 = show game from 2d top down view (like a rougelike)
3 = show game in 3d mode + mini map of 2d in upper rightr

we want to use "rougelike style turn based gameplay loop 4 cleanliness"
but in game "clock" will pass normally ; when not in menu screen
(this can trigger calendar based events)


>event loop , behavior trees, lookup tables. and mvc arch when possible
ie : main.c = gl context share , model.c ,view.c, controller.c = linked

all events should be external plugins to be read from .csv file
when possible to avoid cluttering gl context with data code
and to allow custom plugin creation without coding knowledge

file-submenu with save/load map in chunks to map/map_<number>/

use glut for text but freetype for emojis
use attached candi crush .c as example of how to do basic emoji/glut 
font rendering on my machine

first before we code, lets make an emoji heavy blueprint.md 
to make sure were on the same page. 
describe specifications of game, 
then describe the steps we will take to make our minecraft-like game

i will use this to potentially  prompt a different llm 
if this is too large scope for you, or to start over

⌛️
later will include events.map and break up fx. so dont go 2 hard
honestly im asking u 2 rvngn player.c for more optional players +
event importance edev priority


lower right is always for stremer ava (should be selected-chara head )👨‍🏫️
⌛️

❤️‍🔥️this fiel/project/arc = love ❤️‍🔥️


📮️
make the prompt simpler 4 foundation momentu. use the 3d-shooter 

or use rmmvc may yeild closeest compatability. 

(tell it 2 remove non related stuff)
or just use it for inspiration and build up from scratch)
