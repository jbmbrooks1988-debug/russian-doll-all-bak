currently i have a problem. i create projects in gl/glut (in mvc) but as they start to get bigger they get to hard for ai-code tools to reason about
therefore i wish i could seperate alot of the boiler plate, and even 'unique logic' into external text file.
in gcc c , and open gl/ glut, i want to create a format for making menu's, menu periferals, and canvas elements, simliar to htlm5/canvas


i want to create a framework that can read markup as html or csv (whichever or both) and will render 

i want to use this for 2d/3d games, and menus

we want to create reactive elements (buttons/ thumbs etc) and structural elements (header bars , right click popup menus etc)
as well as the "canvas" which can render 2d and 3d games , with the added benifit of also being able to use the menu elements. all using coords
both relative and absolute

i want to beable to put most of the information in the markup/csv , so that i can even use frame buffer/ html , and other things to render menus
provided i use the same "interpreter" get it? got any advice? 

lets make a blueprint.md exploring the best ways we may do this , and maybe a working example i can critique as main_prototype_0.c
(include as many elements as you can , including logic .
if u want you can use main_prototype_0.c as gl context manager and also link model.c , view.c and controller.c linked into 1 binary at compile. 

architecture : mvc , event drive, lut, fsm <- use when relevant 
rules : no new .h header files (we code in vim so lets not create to many extra files)
