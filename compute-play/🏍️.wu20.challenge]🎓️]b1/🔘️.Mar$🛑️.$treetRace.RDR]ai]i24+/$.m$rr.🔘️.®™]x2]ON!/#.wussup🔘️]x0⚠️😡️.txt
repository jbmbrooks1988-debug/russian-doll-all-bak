im really hating "buttons" so far , but just cuz the directory chaos is confusing
and doesn't feel "dynamic"; but
if u truly have "THINGS IN THERE PLACE" its fine, but it means the peice
isn't independant. do u know why? cuz its supposed to have its own button 
and button is supposed to run THAT BUTTON... get it? then youll be in the right dir
so i probably fucked up big time, but can we test that out? 🔘️
(yea that and or chdir was supposed 2 be used only once in "button.c , u fucking tard"🤪️gitgud

buttons are fine there not 4 u there for the user. what u really hate is being ignorant about dirs. buttons just means
were close 2 ship (if u 'need them' 2 build production ready...)

also ; 2 fix "🔮️🔘️" permanantly = just flag "killer programs"
programs that if killed should kill orchestator .. 
how  >prepend or use special char ie : "*" or w/e "^"= button , maybe nice.] haloshvish🧿️🛸️
