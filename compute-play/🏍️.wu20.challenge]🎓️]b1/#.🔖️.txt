🛑️
🧊️ignore till "npc bank" is going at least
👑️dont forget this should also manage "COUNTRIES" (nonprofits?gangs? cells?) ++ 💱️"FOREX"]DUH💱️<-we want cuz mc-servers etc💱️

{i think we can manage science stuff in tools? or micromanage thru r&d}
💉️
also thinking about changing these : 

0 = . TSOTS MENU STUFF (meta full) <- cloud, management, profiles(spirit) mining etc.
11 = AUCTION? <- cuz yea... also on tsots... ? <-will put in buy/sell

5. Select Player 6. My News 7. Entity Info 8. Select Corp. 9. Select Last 10. General
11. Buy Stock 12. Buy/Sell 13. Financing 14. Sell Stock 15. Management 16. Other Trans


6. = Health / life(style)/culture? <- modify player 'luxury' spend. see player health/friends, df/digimon stuff. move 2 differne locations, do other physical actions? 
 (can have education  , private property . personal realty/transporation , networking etc.
 (entertainmen ie tv/mags vs "grand prix/ polo <-determins wut they're advertised etc" 
[Culture? sposed 2 be for human/ or entity...]
<can give average lifestyle of employees ; or even let u shuffle throu
(or just show 1 , if not a corp. like "15.Management" does.
 
11. Private (Property)? ( can include animals, slaves, robots, cells, automotive,homes etc)
(more ownership management , ie feed , w/e i duno
{can also include planets, universes ,etc "countries will be companies..."like insurance/bank}
<we can sus the rest out later, this is great scaffolding dont sweat it>
14. Realty investments... (not office ie rental management)
(w/b personal r&d = education / patents w/e . we will see just ignore 4 now imo ->
unless its something that makes sense 2 explore with pool+ location/wu (realty does 4 sure)
(id rather use redudant stuff that add new (also can reshuffle)

FINANCIAL TOOLS? <- can put a whole spreadsheet suite here, save reports etc. 


11 = MY TOOLS (my-news can be in here <- they can have 2 buy the apps or w/e irl 2 ie: DLC/IAP) <-  can also do r&d here or w/e . bio stuff   w/e unlock stuff w/e customize ?{Seting}👁️
!!<- we do want a menu that is customizable instead of hardcoded,
so u should be using a "visual bank for menu.w/e tho ez 2 fix"💌️🎟️do b4 its 2l8 imo🎟️📌️#1iz

12 = can easily include crypto as well (forex?)= chill 4 now tho
(its fine 2 put in here with options etc imo

14. = REALTY  (management of real estate. w/e entity. not commercial buying )
(honestly one of these should be r&d and even marketing, tho its in micro so then so shoud this?
w/e ignore just be aaware 

is realty , ie "planet" country" ""LAND""? purchase. like "undeveloped or w/e"? ignore 4 now 
🌽️
(could be under private/property tbh. other property needs management/maint after all
vehicle/ land farm. spaceship. lab tools w/e 

can i cook in here? make chems? cuz property? different storage stuff etc? 🌽️
🔍️

these are (OG) obviously stupid and tenative. i will hold off on them.'

FOREX?<- buy swell


dnot have r&d on main , can be in managemnet tho or life learning? 
also realty management isn't on main. ? 

cutlre = movement?, w/e ignore this tbh

cheat/crime say legal? maybe it should say automate/contracts


GENERAL = whos ahead , etc (data)
------------
i changed some, lets just see wut happens...]

🏭️this has 2 do with wu, but were still holding off. ]INDUSTRY🏭️
👨‍🌾️that kinda stuff rakem pointed out , will become obvious after basics.👨‍🌾️
🧺️however i would like to have "acres / farmers/ seeds/ crops/ slaves" soon..+factories/labs

(even hunting/fishing, we will sort those in after tho, chill)🔍️
🥖️🐟️

+ setup_multiverse.c <-says multi butim gonna quickly pare down 2 
"time passed = billions of years 
focused solar system = sol.system 
focused planet = mars. 

(where are the animals and stuff? 
(honestly they should all be in 1 place easy 2 manage "ARK" 
and we can "colonize/repopulate from there)
🪝️
i want to make hooks 4 this 2 come back 2 w/o going 2 deep 2 distract from wsr finish!
🪝️🎣️
🥡️☀️🌍️🔴️🏝️🏭️🏘️🐄️👬️<- if u look this should literally be same "button 4 fbx" 🧪️🔘️


this give u a chance 2 include "EARTH" <- real

but also "other galaxies (u could buy / but alsoe let fractal inspection
(which should mirror fractal stuff for w/e we do (atoms/bugs/w/e)🐚️


>just make it , in folder . all locations
all humans. all animals. everything should be in here. 
ie :  multiverse/mars/life/humans

mv/mars/


and yes they can leave dir, like fbx.

(add 2 save/load)

*do the old options. it will help u think about what designer did and stop distraction.
ie : "change management/reorg can be good if "weights are 'bad'"<-regen.

(i would get human pool going soon tho , so u can put "names",etc <ezr peice relatability 2>
maybe worth while 2 drill into wu <cuz it only deals with customers/employees = pool>
then we can inform exactly how we want ai trade 2 work instead of winging it (momentum4kell)
<by that i mean revisiting things sometimes confuses them & caused resistance>
& we can straddle "peices" & even estabish location/realty in a meaning ful way. 
as well as push into "llm based r&d etc" which makes even more sense b4 doing ai 4 game w/e

so we may push into micro manage
we may look @ legal 4 other reasons "anti trust suit contract being 1 option of contrx +custom"




+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
also back 2 financing , we can sell private or ipo . 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

🪛️
tldr ; drill " thru ppl pool / wu  , so its there as a factor ez access. <-its micro
<- drill to multi planet/dimension real estate 2 , then thats taken care of

<- can employees be animals? are they inventory 4 farms? {im asking 4 cells btw}
< its moving inventory just like robots... but i see ur point tbh. but just push
we will drill in from a place of knowledge not theory
🪛️🚇️🔍️
🌏️if were drilling 2 humans, and realty , and thinking of animals... its time 4 big bang🌏️
(however we always end up with mars...so , "guide it but with hooks"

think about cave men but also ignore them. should work with menu first. 
🪝️just "speed thru big bang , while leaving hooks for "NGL.MPYR"🪝️
do setup_multiverse.c at least <- if u dont u never will. 
🐩️if u figure out how to manage animals, same as humans , u can do cells/atoms/robots w/e🐩️
🏎️ speed thru 2 human/animal/realty/natural_resource pool, 2 wsr/wu , &member were on mars🔴️

🦈️the worry is derailing 2 do this now , may permanntly taint WSR so w8 till classic is done🔍️

(then generate balance sheet/portfolio for each gov (bailout? etc)+health/property-weapons.
🏋‍♀️️
balance sheet 4 a gov is gonna look like "BANK/INSURY" corp {special / weird /nuanced}
ur probably better off looking @ this ts : 
(its culture actions will look diff 2 (like civ [movement of 'miliunits'/not me+property]
corp[autom movement of coporate units{farming]qlu🔍️}]
