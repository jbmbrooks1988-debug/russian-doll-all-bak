Human-AI Cohabitation System Flow Map 🚀🤖📋
==========================================

[Overview] 🌟
This ASCII flow map illustrates the data and control flow in our system, where humans 👤 and AI 🤖 
interact via a shared ledger and finite state machine. The map shows how financing.c, master_reader.c, 
and incorporation.c collaborate using Event-Driven Architecture 📬, Blackboard Architecture 📋, 
Finite State Machine (FSM) 🔄, and Actor Model 🎭.

[Flow Steps & Pattern Annotations] 📝
1. Human Input (financing.c) 👤
   - Pattern: Event-Driven 📬
   - Human uses menu to input corp details (e.g., "Acme Auto", "AAUTO", 101).
   - financing.c writes to data/master_ledger.txt (e.g., "Time: 2025-08-31 | Debit: AAUTO | ...").
   - Acts as an event producer, adding to the shared blackboard 📋.

2. AI Input 🤖
   - Pattern: Event-Driven 📬, Blackboard 📋
   - AI writes directly to data/master_ledger.txt with same event format.
   - Shares the blackboard with humans, enabling cohabitation 🤝.

3. Event Processing (master_reader.c) 🔄
   - Pattern: Finite State Machine 🔄, Event-Driven 📬, Actor Model 🎭
   - Reads data/master_reader.txt to get last processed line (FSM state).
   - Reads data/master_ledger.txt, processes only new lines (post-state).
   - For each "incorporation.+x" event, parses fields and calls incorporation.c via system().
   - Acts as an independent actor, processing events asynchronously.

4. State Management (data/master_reader.txt) 📋
   - Pattern: Finite State Machine 🔄
   - Stores last processed line number (e.g., "1"), updated after each run.
   - Ensures no duplicate processing, maintaining system integrity 🛑.

5. Core Execution (incorporation.c) 💼
   - Pattern: Actor Model 🎭, Blackboard 📋
   - Receives arguments from master_reader.c (e.g., date, ticker, corp_name).
   - Creates corporation files, shareholder lists, and updates portfolios.
   - Writes to shared blackboard (corporations/generated/*, players/*/portfolio.txt).
   - Same logic used by humans and AI, ensuring equality 🤝.

6. Output Files 📁
   - Pattern: Blackboard 📋
   - corporation files (e.g., corporations/generated/AAUTO/AAUTO.txt).
   - Shareholder lists, martian_corporations.txt, player portfolios.
   - Shared outputs accessible to all agents, closing the loop 🌍.

[Pattern Synergy] 🤯
- Event-Driven 📬: Decouples producers (human/AI) from consumers (master_reader.c).
- Blackboard 📋: data/master_ledger.txt and output files enable shared state.
- FSM 🔄: master_reader.c ensures deterministic, stateful processing.
- Actor Model 🎭: Independent programs communicate via files/system calls.
Together, they create a system where humans and AI cohabitate, using the same execution
path via a ledger-driven FSM. Humans feel like they're "interacting through" the AI's
workflow, making this AI-native yet human-friendly. 🌟👤🤖

This "Collaborative Ledger-Driven FSM" could be a novel pattern for human-AI systems,
where agents share a persistent event queue and state machine, enabling scalable,
decentralized collaboration. Explore its applications in game economies, simulations,
or multi-agent AI systems! 🚀📚

### Explanation of the Flow Map
- **Visual Structure**:
  - **ASCII Diagram**: Shows the flow from human/AI inputs to `master_ledger.txt`, through `master_reader.c` (with `master_reader.txt` for state), to `incorporation.c`, and finally to output files.
  - **Components**: Each program and file is a box, with arrows indicating data/control flow.
  - **Pattern Labels**: Arrows and steps are annotated with the architectural patterns they represent (e.g., “Event-Driven”, “FSM”).
- **Steps**:
  1. **Human Input**: `financing.c` collects inputs and writes to the ledger (Event-Driven, Blackboard).
  2. **AI Input**: AI writes directly to the ledger, sharing the blackboard with humans.
  3. **Event Processing**: `master_reader.c` reads new ledger lines, acting as an FSM and event processor.
  4. **State Management**: `master_reader.txt` tracks the last processed line (FSM).
  5. **Core Execution**: `incorporation.c` executes logic as an independent actor, writing to output files (Blackboard

  A blackboard system is an artificial intelligence approach based on the blackboard architectural model,[1][2][3][4] where a common knowledge base, the "blackboard", is iteratively updated by a diverse group of specialist knowledge sources, starting with a problem specification and ending with a solution. Each knowledge source updates the blackboard with a partial solution when its internal constraints match the blackboard state. In this way, the specialists work together to solve the problem. The blackboard model was originally designed as a way to handle complex, ill-defined problems, where the solution is the sum of its parts. ♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️♣️
