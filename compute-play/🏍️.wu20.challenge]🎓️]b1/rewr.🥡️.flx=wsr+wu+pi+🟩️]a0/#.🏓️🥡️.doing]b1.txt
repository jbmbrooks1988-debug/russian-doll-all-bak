were stopping 🛑️ MSRR abruptly pre ai.🤖️ 🛑️ 

were going 2 reformat it into a flexbox

🔘️
button will run and 
either start an old market (gen a new market)
and just run all ai corps , no menu. 
and u can literally gen a player using a seperate button 
{2 just hop in/out a market}
(or include in first button w/e u like) 
and use its menu . 2 trade. 


(corps are peices, the logic in a plugin of 🛑️.MSRR.APP.®™/ ) 
which will use ../../ or w/e -> quick, yet imperative refactor!s❣️
++++++++

y? 

cuz then we will set up 2 or 3 peices , just 2 make them trade
(will do anat / etc later but ,soon💌️)


🏗️ and we will make sure all 3 have compatibile ai scaffolds🏗️ 
(and finish all 3 then do mr/chatbots/libra-gen-mo /rmmv-tile/3d etc
🤖️
🔘️▶️
u may want to break a few things out 2 better resemble 
peice logic. that way we can seamlessly go back and forth;

after all these corps/govs are peices (inside of buildings)
and our OG-PEICES dont even have to interact with them
2 trade with eachother  / grow food w/e (buy from smol shops)
but hopefully they use similiar structures so we can 
SISTINE them together when the time comes 
(piece can go get a job/join army{civ} or w/e)
(we also may make a diff menu screen for civ 
so plus if these can hook interchangbly or do from same menu
(civ can go thru wsr menu 🏰️]AOW🗡️
(peice can be managed on its own , but also 
should beable to start the wsr menu using "peice" as the player
(instead of 'anti-spirit)<- will sort that l8er as well.👻️🤺️
🗡️


⏯️(players menu can pause stopwatch)
have usual functions (need 2 eat or able 2 cut that off) 
and introduce real estate/ contracts, 
then we can weave that into WSR menu , as planned with full compat🧭️🥳️STOKED🍨️

🚳️WU? 
we could look at FBX refactoring 'WU'for compat/ref ai 
but im talking WAY after refactoring WSR 2 FBX... 
 doing peice 2 peice trade (geminai shold sus out)
i want 2 peices going w/o me with ability 2 interject pre-wu-look
this lets us do simple FSM/RL/MLP/LLM
so we can decide how we wanna do WSR (since theres no 'right way')
THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY🔍️
🐢️🐇️
🚳️
🫀️
this is certainly pre anatoy tho it may come into play
as well as corpusing if we get to the "tangible r&d"/marketing ♎️
if u really do get all this stuff setup, 
do blockchain , do ur personal website + copywrite gen etc.
and start getting users using "PRICE DISCRIMINATED APP TEIRS"
running on RV-II p2p cloud situation ++ websearch -ai chat cli etc...
then def ask about law/med w/e 
pre- going ham on monetization/marketing cuz why not
esp if u can do it fast w/o arousing suspicion . ohyea & contrax!📜️👨🏽‍⚖️️
🎪️
+ sus out how we wanna weave interaction thru diff apps
its discord + weave in sp
+ rmmv tiles 2 map conversion = big foot in door 4 playerbase? 

prolly def wanna do that stuff PRE SKEWL (as GM marketing 301)🀄️

each day that passes, companies should do business with other companies. 
🎖️🥇️
first , they should buy and sell goverment long/short bonds. period . (nothing fancy , just sim superficial - b-but we have govs, they have a budget? sure it should be bought from the gov 2 help their REAL budget. and maybe yes we will tax population? - but were not gonna go much deeper than that right now)
🥇️
🥈️
then? they should give loans to others to do so (first based on nothing , then credit etc) 

  + margin calls, w/e etc
  + bond issuance (diff from loan)
🥈️

🥉️
then? we may differentiate between "banks/insurance; and other companies.
start ipo/ buying selling , stocks(short) / options/futures
 may even do locations realty sub menus
but make sure other 7day reqs are done first. 

def employees 2 a certain extent. ceo w/e making room for wu . cuz wu is goal. 

🥅️
if u get this far uve done most of the heavy lifting.
🥅️
🥉️
u should meet basic wsr requirements first tho so u dont get confused b4 adding desires.😵‍💫️

commodities should be moving based on supply demand population employment w/e

it occurs 2 me that this would be easer 2 reason about
(esp the gov stuff etc if it started from "nothing' <-but it does...
like 1 company . 2 population <-or something reasonably small / manageable. 
fine w/e 

are plan waas always 2 fake gen company names/genre based on supply demand of ppl tbh. 
like , population is increasing? more farming companies, more demand 4 grain. etc.
(but if they produce 2 much , prices go down, get into the nitty gritty 
or else till then keep it super high level and intentionally avoid these hooks.
or make the hooks very abstract imo thats the best even tho it requires "TINY BIT OF THOT"☯️🪝️🎣️

even tho that my sound A BIT more complicated architecturally 
it maybe helplful but that is no reason not 2 do the basics now...😵‍💫️🪝️🎣️🚩️

   input correctly. modify @db_search.c to do what              
   @src/file_submenu.c is doing   
🅰️says its cause subs call clear_screen()? 
but shouldn't they be allowed to do that? ; 
oh well we will address when needed, these are still modules after all.
♟️
<the 2nd peice menu is really good..@ running w/e sub programs its given so
its def this prog, but those should have a copyable fix
♟️


👩🏻‍🏭️
both of these are multi tier nested menu screens run as child processes of "main.c" however file_submenu.c's sub menus show up in cli , but db_searchs.c's dont show up as child of main.c (they do show up on their own) ; we know the problem isn't main.c because file_submenu.c's submenus show up when run as child.  how do we fix db_searches.c ? 
👩🏻‍🏭️
i was just pressing 22 , instead of 27 ] 

Enter your choice: ^CExiting submenu...
Press Enter to return to main menu...
(gonna leave this , maybe i will want it w/e ez 2 remove later.)

    displays actual results... (its just a placeholder for now,   
    lets write the code)    ---------------
    
    
    ✦ Okay, I understand. You want to implement the actual search and
  display functionality for option 14 in db_search.c.

  Here's my plan:

   1. Enhance `parse_corporation_file()`: I will modify this
      function to read and parse the data from individual
      corporation files (e.g., AAPL.txt) located in
      corporations/generated/. I'll assume these files have a
      consistent format for corporation details.
   2. Implement `display_search_results()`: This function will:
       * Scan the corporations/generated/ directory for all
         corporation data files.
       * For each file, it will call the enhanced
         parse_corporation_file() to load the corporation's data.
       * It will then apply the currently set search criteria
         (e.g., high_return_on_equity, low_pe_ratio, etc.) to
         filter the corporations.
       * Finally, it will display the details of all corporations
         that match the criteria.
   3. Integrate: I will update the display_db_search_menu() to call
      the display_search_results() function when the user selects
      option 14.

  I will assume the corporation files in corporations/generated/
  have the following format:

   1 Name: <Corporation Name>
   2 Ticker: <Ticker Symbol>
   3 Net Worth Per Share: <double value>
   4 Current Stock Price: <double value>
   5 Total Stock Capitalization (Millions): <double value>
   6 Long Term Bonds Issued: <double value>

aug12 . to do : 

add save/load to "file submenu" as file_submenu.c
but in order to do that we need to fix
"menu index to start at "File" as 1. ie : 1.File , etc
----
(also lets add the other executables to @\#.compile.sh )

📅️aug14_17-52: { ./+x/1.read_calendar.+x wgu_ctdn📅️🦉️.txt 17 days remaining until 2025-09-01  }

ok, just getting days 2 pass and show on screen is goal 4 now ; redraw is no big deal cuz mino does it ez.
🥇️⏱️ok new task : under 3.settings  @settings_submenu.c 1.ticker_speed (should show options: [cent, sec,min, hour, day])  allow user to change (based on index) when chosen as 1.ticker_speed

 then save user choice to saves/settings.txt 

(default should be cent) <-✅️]DONE!


 ok.this is how long it will take to pass a full 24 hours in game. = 24 seconds.
(this is the speed the game clock will go (normal 24 hour clock but at this speed) 
24 centisec = .24 sec

time should be shown , for example as : Date: January 1, 2025 24:00:00:00  
(with last field being centiseconds)


currently this is passing a year everytime turn is ended. however thats not how this simulation is supposed to work. 
the days are supposed to just step by based on "Ticker Speed"(and pause if ticker on/off is set to off as option 22. in game.c

the turns dont affect time at all. players simply wait for eachother to finish . those are the game rules. dont ask.get it?

-✅️]DONE!

🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️🕰️
📅️aug14_1-32: starting on "2 > news " now. 


each turn is passing "years" instead of "days. obv want to fix that. 
(also the days are just supposed to pass without affecting the turn . 
2 explain 2 gemini how wsr actually passes time | grok...
(literally while u are sitting there) <- "WHAT!?" (just do it) 


>days just pass (ai should be doing 'news') , "SETTINGS (changes speed of time 1-99) [ticker on/off]=paws
 and honestly should just beable to step thru . <-first mod. youll want 4 dev... no biggi.]w84reg tho]
 {later can save every state & step back (point of saves tho tbh) <-trunk w/e diff match etc}
(also are we showing dynamic ticker? <can refresh on days, w/e>
(when is humanplayer 2 turn? never. will just keep running time. w/e copy THAT )


{i may even do this in grok, if its modular enough. if not, maybe make it so. this is a big deal. }-✅️]DONE!
⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️
📅️aug14_1-20: maybe do "time passing" (but wait on ai ) do human "buy/sell" etc first. 
then let ai do it... (or both at same time 2 make sure the functions can be reused as "sub module"
(if not w/e its ez 2 rewire later; never works out magically 1rst time anyways, just push)


i may "detach startup setup screens as a seperate module that calls game.c after"
 have them pass as optional args or default starting_data.txt 
(then we can start fast each debug <- do this. 

then we can decide to start with "different screens (even usr could decide)
im thinking of seperating "main display" from "main menu"
not sure which should show first (leaning 2 menu, but u should experiment) ofc u can do both 2 but has 2 refresh
so u may as well have diff options in case 2 breaks


📭️
✦ You've got it. The current setup prioritizes the quick start if
  starting_data.txt exists. I'll adjust it so that manual setup is the
  default.

  I will modify main.c to delete starting_data.txt before it runs the
  setup module. This means:
   - Running ./wsr will always give you the manual, interactive setup.
   - To get the fast, debug startup, you can run ./game_setup
     directly, which will use an existing starting_data.txt file.

  I'll make that change now.
📭️
cat starting_data.
txt 
num_players:1
game_length:5
starting_cash:50000
player_0_name:Human
player_0_type:0

||
cat starting_data.
txt 
num_players:2
game_length:10
starting_cash:10000.00
player_0_name:p1
player_0_type:0
player_1_name:p2
player_1_type:0
-------------------------------------------------------------📭️✅️
🥷🏽️ i also made nino(mino) "toggle tabs" ; will it be easier 2 use than screen scroll| sub menu? w/e try both  

(could toggle terminal ; were already in one (could place "news at top?)
(watch list on side?) 
🥷🏽️ <- otherwise hold off on dynamic data in main 4 now. ; other than date/ commodities (will prob do away with soon)📟️
⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️
🔄️
!.noticed:
!. [esc] key is more intuive than ctrl+c by a long shot
💬️
currently we use ctrl+c to back out of menus
, can we add the same functionality for [esc]? 
(its more user intuitive

also if user [esc]'s main menu(would quit), pls ask them 
if they want to exit without saving to confirm

(suggested using ncurses;ignore this 4 now )
💬️

0. load game or new / sort out save  {difficulty doesn't seem 2 matter}
<ez inject pre "picker screens" instances/ <- load file (copy 2/from generated/)>

☑️(done-ish ) theres some things that look weird
like its not saving enough corps... , im gonna punch thru tho. , this isn't even necessarily necissary 4 punching thru
just proof of "SPACE_avail" ☑️

⚠️(post-0.)
things dont happen when turn ends, its  game over. 
(should be going to another turn. 
, wait 2 do in order (ie step 2-ish?)yea 

-> i may advance turns b4 i do db search, 
i think it has more momentum...but if i fails, 
maybe ill rollback.

2nd thot, its gonna be a big task involving multiple
ai interactions, u may just wanna keep "organized"
