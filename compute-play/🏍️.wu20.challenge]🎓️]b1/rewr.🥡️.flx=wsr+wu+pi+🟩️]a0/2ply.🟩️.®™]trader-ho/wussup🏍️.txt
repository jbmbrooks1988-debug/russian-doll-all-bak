i just wanna get a quick giga pet going. 
whenever there is item it should exist. 

i may make a simple "store" so gemini knows what to connect things with (instead of food coming from "nowhwere")
(this would connect with wsr, and they will have an inventory ) 
(i may also make a "hotel" where they can spend money to sleep , and a "gym" where they can train 4 $)
(im gonna make a bank too, 🏦️🏪️🏫️ will make a school where chatbot can learn. do u understand the scope of this? 
(finally we will make other peices.) 

(if we do store first, (cuz items/ inventory) then hotel 
or hotel first cuz easier , just take money from me, put it on hotel 'state.txt'
then renew my sleep 


they're scared 2 mess with this lol , but this is easier than halo.c <3


<were not focused on anatomy yet, this is sistine chapel. were bringing suble arch scaffolding from WSR 2 here.2 inform>

👛️🪙️these folders have kind of a strange structure "Not std" however we like flexibility
maybe we can make a flexible parser, if gem could help with this (it can) that would pull us A  PRETTY LONG WAY UP ARCH WISE

👛️🪙️(i think ill do this quickly 2day before going back 2 wsr. there related in this commercial way...)📅️aug16💤️
