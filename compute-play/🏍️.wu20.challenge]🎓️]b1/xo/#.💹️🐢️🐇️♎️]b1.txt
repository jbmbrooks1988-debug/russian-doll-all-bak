in @game.c i want to make a new submodule (management.c) for 15.Management
once launched by system()
it will check active_entity.txt . if "player"(name) it will show "placeholder"<- will do later

if active_entity = a corporation (most of the time it will) we will show the following options : 
1.Elect me as CEO of <active_entity>   <- fix, take salary (also theres no salary info
2.Resign me as CEO of <active_entity>
3.Reorg  <------ meh ignore goes 2 micro , put salary info here or below w/e
(altho imo it could be 2 set "employement spend in general" (ie how big ur team is)
(opposite of micro manage , just a "slider"; just like r&d tbh)
(then micro manage would let u 'go deep" on all that stuff, i really like that 4ever tbh)😶‍🌫️️
{this micro macro is fine <- clu , and we will do animal-pool]noah once u iron 1-10 out here}
🛶️->🛸️may do "super speed universe.c setup also

5.Set R&D Spend
6.Set Marketing Spend

📌️
focus on 4-7 then 1 & 2 . <- make sure u get a salary . and pay tax. 
and ur main menu updates... then we can look @ buy sell + employee stock options


or check out 1& 2 in sim first, see how they manifest accross menus etc... 

🚝️ceo really only seems 2 affect "payment of salary 2 player" (but should be salary 4 all ppl)
(so im gonna ignore that one) 
cuz it maybe confusing. 

dividend is same but shouldnt be as confusing cuz u "KNOW" its 4 others 2. 
5. r&d spend (is percent of sales)

i dont see how this stuff makes sense w/o a 'ppl pool' ala wsr
(well it does, based on weights + industry weights, which u should actually 
do as surface first. cuz it gives "MACRO HOOKS" = scaffolding speed

@I0338
 - MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS. The "Management" button on the main
W$R screen brings up a pop-up Management menu that lets you
do any of a number of management-related actions, when you
control a company, either to affect its profitability, or to
enable you to take money out of the company, such as by paying
yourself a salary as President and CEO of the company, or by
changing the amount to be paid out as quarterly dividends
to stockholders.
🔖️
🧸️
The various Management Transactions are described below.

@I0339
   ... ELECT ME AS CEO OF COMPANY button.  Click on this
button to elect yourself as the President/CEO of the currently
selected company (if it is one you control). Doing so will
mean that you will receive an annual salary from the company,
paid in quarterly installments, as a company expense. Your
compensation is largely tied to the price of the company's
stock, so the bigger the company (and its capitalization),
the bigger your paycheck, as a rule. However, banks and
insurance companies tend to pay less than industrial companies,
and holding companies often pay very little, even if they are
very large, and the same is true of industrial companies that
have only a small amount of capital assets, if most of their
assets are in passive holdings such as cash or stocks of other
companies.

Under the compensation formula, the higher you can keep the
company's stock price per share above its net worth per share,
the larger your pay will be, as a rule, so you have a strong
incentive to get the stock price up as high as possible.
This is especially true since your CEO compensation package
will also include quarterly grants of valuable stock options
on the company's stock, if its stock is publicly traded.

In addition to your quarterly salary payments, you may also
receive a bonus of up to 5 times the annual base salary rate,
if you are able to increase the company's earnings (which must
be a positive amount) by over 15% a year for several consecutive
years and, if you control at least 51% of the stock, your bonus 
will be double what it would otherwise be. Even if earnings are
negative or do not increase, you will still receive a year-end
bonus equal to 1 times the annual base salary rate if you
control 51% of the company, so it definitely pays to control
at least 51% of the stock of the company you are employed by!

In W$R, you can only be CEO of one company at a time, so
you should usually choose to become CEO of the company
you control that pays the largest CEO salary, in order to
maximize your annual compensation income. Also, be aware
that once you cease to be CEO of a company, unless you
still control that company, any executive stock options
you were granted by it will be revoked (forfeited by
you), unless they have vested. Such options do not vest
until one year after date of grant.

Use the "Who's Ahead" button on the "Entity Info" menu,
if you control more than one corporation, to find out
which company you control has the largest capitalization,
as the information in the "Who's Ahead" screen will tell
you the name of the largest company you control. Often,
the largest company will pay the largest salary.

Note that if a competing player is CEO of a company, and you
take control of that company, you can elect yourself as the
new CEO, and the other player will be fired, which can be a
source of considerable pleasure. (Just don't try that little
maneuver if the other player happens to be your spouse.)

@I0340
   ... RESIGN AS CEO OF COMPANY button.  Click on this button
to resign as President/CEO of a corporation, if you would prefer
not to receive a CEO salary from any company. (Any salary or
bonus you receive from a corporation is an expense that reduces
the corporation's earnings.) Note that if you resign as CEO of
a company, any unvested stock options you were granted by
that company will be revoked immediately if you no longer
control the company, or will be revoked later if you should
eventually lose control of the company before the options
vest.

Note also, if you have "seniority" with the company of 
which you are currently the CEO, that is a prerequisite
to earning performance bonuses for increasing the company's
earnings in subsequent years. If you resign, you will lose
that seniority, and will be starting from scratch if you
become CEO of another company. Accordingly, if you have
"seniority" that will be lost, the program will ask you
if you are sure you wish to resign as CEO and lose that
employment history.

@I0341
   ... CHANGE MANAGERS button.  Click on this button to change
(fire) the management team of a company you control. (The executives
fired will not include you, of course, if you are the company's
CEO and President -- only your subordinates will be terminated). 

This will cost the company money, as all the top executives
always have "golden parachute" contracts -- so the company may
have to pay them millions when you fire and replace them. This
will initially put a big dent in the company's earnings.
However, in a few quarters or perhaps a few years, you will
finally see a news announcement, if you watch the news ticker
closely, indicating whether the new management team is a success,
no improvement, or (worst of all), a disaster.

In general, read a research report on the company, and don't
use the Chg. Managers transaction unless the management team
is rated as incompetent (or grossly incompetent). You will
DEFINITELY not want to change the managers if they are rated
as "very capable" by the Research Report on the company, as
the odds are that the new management team will not be as good.

This button does not appear if you, the player, are the 
currently selected "Active Entity" or if you do not control 
any corporations.

@I0342
   ... SET DIVIDEND PAYOUT button.  Click on this button to
change the amount the selected company pays out to you and
other stockholders as dividends. The program will set limits
on how high a dividend a company may pay, per share. In
general, the stronger a company's credit rating, the larger
the dividends it may pay out.

Dividends are fully taxable to individual players, so you may
not want to have companies you own directly pay out a high
percentage of profits to you as dividends, as "regular" tax
rates for individuals are quite high. Better to let the money
stay in the corporation and increase the value of your stock,
deferring any tax on you until you sell the stock -- and even
then you will pay much lower capital gains tax rates!

Unlike individual shareholders, corporate shareholders pay
very little tax on dividends they receive from corporate stocks
they own. The amount taxed depends on the percent ownership of
the dividend payor. If the parent company owns 80% or more of
the payor's stock, any dividends are tax-free to the parent
(as the companies are treated as filing a single "consolidated"
tax return).

If the parent owns between 20% and 79% of the payor, only
20% of the dividend received is taxable. If the parent
company owns less than 20% of the payor's stock, it pays
tax on only 30% of the dividends received.

This function is for any selected corporation controlled
by the player, but not for the player himself or herself.
(People don't pay dividends; corporations do.) Thus, this
button does not appear if the currently selected "Active
Entity" is you, the player.

@I0343
   ... SET PRODUCTIVITY SPENDING button.  Click on this button
to change the percentage of sales or gross income that a company
spends on increasing its profits and productivity, which is
for R & D (research and development) spending for companies
in technical industries, or for advertising/marketing for
companies in other industries, such as banking, shipping,
or trucking. The more a company spends, the more it reduces
its pre-tax profits, so in the short run, spending a high
percentage (say 15% or 20%) of gross income on R&D or
advertising may hurt the company's earnings and stock price.

However, there is a good possibility that such spending will
eventually lead to a big improvement in its profitability,
and if you then cut back on such spending, you can boost its
profits even further. If a company is losing money or appears
to be incompetently managed, increasing its productivity
spending percentage may increase its losses, but may be the
best way to eventually turn the company around .... if it does
not go broke, first.

Note:  This button is not displayed if the currently selected
"Active Entity" is you, the player, as this function is only
applicable to corporations. It is also not displayed if the
current "Active Entity" is a holding / trading company, unless
the holding/trading company is not controlled by you and the
previously selected "Active Entity" was a corporation that is
controlled by you (and is not a holding/trading company).

@I0344
   ... SET GROWTH RATE% button.  Click on this button to change
the selected company's rate of expansion, which is the amount
or rate at which it is growing its capital assets. If the
company is highly profitable, earning, say 30% on its business
capital assets, you might want to "step on the accelerator"
and have it expand rapidly, to increase profits. If, on the
other hand, it is losing money, or earning a very poor return
on its capital assets (less than the cost of its borrowed
funds, for example), then you might want to reduce its growth
rate, even to as much as -10% a year, which means it will be
converting 10% of its assets to cash each year, as the assets
are depreciated.

🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️🛑️




















If the selected company is an insurance company, setting the
growth rate determines how fast it is expanding its base of
insurance policies in force. As a general rule, if it is
expanding its business rapidly, it has to do so by taking on
riskier business, and thus its underwriting profit on its
insurance activities will tend to shrink or underwriting losses
will rise. Decreasing the growth rate of insurance in force,
or actually shrinking its business by weeding out high-risk
customers, will improve underwriting profitability. However,
since the amount of insurance policy reserves is like an
interest-free loan, on which the company can earn investment
profits by buying stocks, bonds and bank CDs, an insurer is
usually willing to tolerate some level of underwriting losses
in order to increase the amount of its insurance in force.

This transaction, for setting a company's growth rate, is
for insurers and "industrial" companies only, not for banks,
holding / trading companies, or for individual players, none
of whom have "capital assets" like factories, airplanes,
ships, etc., or insurance policy reserves.

Note:  This button is not displayed if the currently selected
"Active Entity" is you, the player, as this function is only
applicable to corporations. It is also not displayed if the
current "Active Entity" is a holding / trading company, unless
the holding/trading company is not controlled by you and the
previously selected "Active Entity" was a corporation that is
controlled by you (and is not a holding/trading company).

@I0345
   ... RESTRUCTURE button.  Click on this button if you
control a company that is very unprofitable, and has
incompetent management (other than financial companies).
This will allow a company to "restructure" by shutting
down (at a big loss) money losing operations, while
making remaining operations more efficient and profitable.
Depending on your company's financial strength, you may
be able (and willing) to write off as much as 50% of
a company's capital assets in a restructuring, although
that would be a very drastic writedown.

Doing a restructuring will usually result in a large loss
for the current quarter, so it may temporarily clobber
the price of your company's stock. However, for a sick
company, it may be the only way to stop it from constantly
losing money. The more you spend to restructure, the
weaker the company will be, in terms of its credit
rating, but the more likely you will quickly increase
its relative profitability.

This is a very powerful tool, but if overdone, or used
in the wrong situation, can turn a sick company into a
bankrupt company very quickly, so use it with caution.

Note:  This button is not displayed if the currently selected
"Active Entity" is you, the player, as this function is only
applicable to corporations. It is also not usually displayed
if the current "Active Entity" is a bank, insurance company,
or a holding / trading company that you control, none of which
have "capital assets" to write down, in W$R.

@I0346
   ... ANTITRUST SUIT button.  Click on this button if you want
a company you control to file an antitrust lawsuit against a
dominating or monopolistic company in its industry (other than
in banking, insurance, or holding company industries). In
general, if one company (including subsidiaries it controls,
or other companies under common control by the same player)
controls a market share of over 50% in a particular industry,
there is a good chance you can win an antitrust suit against
it, or at least extract a large settlement from it, that
more than covers your legal expenses.

In general, the better law firm you have, and the worse law
firm the defendant company has, the better your chances of
winning a lawsuit against the defendant. However, the better
law firms charge a lot more in fees.

Before you file an antitrust suit, click on the "Game
Options/Select Law Firm" drop down menu item on the
Main Menu, and choose either a Cheap, Average, or Expensive
law firm, as you feel is best. You may only be able to
afford the Cheap law firm, but that may be OK if the company
you are suing has a 75% market share and thus you know you
are almost certain to win a case against it.

If you don't select a law firm, you will be assumed to have
selected an Average law firm. Note that your selection of
law firms will also affect any harassing lawsuits filed
by you or your companies, or filed against companies you
control by other players or their companies.

Note that if you try to monopolize an industry by taking
over most of the larger companies, or by rapidly expanding
a dominant company so it increases its market share way
above 50%, and drives smaller competitors out of business,
you will probably find that other surviving companies in
the industry will file antitrust suits against your company,
so your company will be the defendant.

Whether you are suing or defending an antitrust lawsuit,
you will be given a chance to make a settlement offer before
going to trial, which may or may not be an amount the other
party is willing to accept. For example, if you are suing
for $5 billion, and are only willing to settle the case for
$4.5 billion, it's VERY unlikely the other party will settle,
so you will have to take your chances in a trial. But if
you offered to settle for $1 billion, the other party might
very well agree to pay you the $1 billion, if you have a
strong case. (You'll eventually learn from trial and error,
what kind of settlement offers to make or accept, to maximize
your profits or minimize your costs.)

If the company bringing a lawsuit would be bankrupted by the
litigation costs, if it fails to win a settlement or judgment,
the case will usually be dismissed.

Note:  This button is not displayed if the currently selected
"Active Entity" is you, the player, as this function is only
applicable to corporations. It is also not displayed if you
control the current "Active Entity" and it is a bank, insurance
company, or a holding / trading company.

   ... SET FUND ADVISOR FEE button.  Click on this button for
a securities brokerage or insurance company you control, to
change the management fees it charges to any Exchange-Traded
Funds (ETF) that your company manages as investment advisor.
The annual fee it can charge to an ETF can be set at rates
between 0.2% and 1.0% of the ETF's total assets, collected in
quarterly installments. Changing a management fee rate is one
of the five transactions a player is allowed per turn. However,
if the player's company manages more than one ETF, you will be
asked for each if you want to change the fee, and if you do so
for more than one "client" ETF while paging through them, it
will only count as one transaction.

Note:  This button is not displayed unless the current "Active
Entity" is a company you control that is either a securities
brokerage company or an insurance company, unless the current
"Active Entity" is a company you do not control and the previously
selected "Active Entity" was a securities brokerage or insurance
company that you do control, which will be doing this transaction.

@I0348
   ... TOGGLE AUTOPILOT ON/OFF button. Click on this button to
toggle the "AutoPilot" setting for the selected (controlled)
company on or off. When AutoPilot is turned off, you must
manage the company yourself (the default situation). When
AutoPilot is turned on, the software manages the company for
you, though your permission will be requested before a company
on AutoPilot engages in certain major transactions, such as
buying or selling stocks of other companies, or issuing new
stock.

When you use the "AutoPilot (Global) ON/OFF" setting on the
"Game Settings" pulldown menu, it turns the AutoPilot setting
ON or OFF for all companies you control. However, you can use
this "Toggle" button to change the setting for any individual
company you control (except that the setting is always "OFF" for
a company of which you are President and CEO). For example, you
may have turned the global setting "ON" for all your companies,
but you can use this button on the Management Menu to turn
AutoPilot off for any specific company you control. Or vice
versa, if the global setting is "OFF," you can turn AutoPilot
"ON" for a specific company. (Or later turn it back "OFF.")

one day your compiler could compile and save things as a kvp.txt <esp with a match algo.c> 
then it could update old kvp...
THEN files that access those, could access by kvp...

 sprintf(command, "unzip -o saves/%s.zip -d saves/", save_name);
 
 + add 2 starting_data.txt on save (u can literally do this by hand tbh)🐛️
