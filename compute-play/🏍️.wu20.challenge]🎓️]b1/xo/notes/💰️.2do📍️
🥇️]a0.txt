âœ¦ Based on our progress, here are some suggested next steps to enhance the
  AI and game mechanics:

   1. Expand the AI's Knowledge: We can enhance the AI_Corporation struct in
      ai_module.c to include more financial details like total assets,
      liabilities, and stock price. This will allow the AI to make more
      intelligent decisions.

   2. Implement Inter-Corporation Loans: We can create a system where
      corporations can request loans from each other (especially from
      banks). This would be the first real "business" transaction and would
      involve:
       * AI logic to identify when a loan is needed.
       * AI logic for banks to evaluate and approve/deny loan requests.
       * A mechanism to update the financial sheets of both corporations
         involved.

   3. Develop AI Personalities: We can give corporations different financial
      strategies or "personalities" (e.g., aggressive, conservative,
      growth-focused). This would influence their decisions regarding loans,
      investments, and other business activities.

   4. Create Dynamic News Events: The AI's actions can generate headlines in
      the financial news, such as major loan agreements or investment deals.
      This would make the game world more dynamic and responsive to the AI's
      activities.

  Let me know which of these you'd like to focus on, or if you have another
  idea in mind.

companies can buy control of other companies by owning majority share. 
companies may issue shares
were gonna want ai to use the same menu options & modules players use.
we want the ai to be an ai_orchestator.c and ai_module.c , ai_module should handle the individual
actions of 1 entity, like "non_human player" , while orchestrator can handle managment of many ai.
 controlled in game corporations .
 review the menu options currently in place, and decide what new menu modules we should be building next.

 9. financing allows users to contribute money to form a new company .or issue shares for existing.
