i want to try to rewrite this ms-dos/x86 stock market simulator in 
gcc c. 

remember : its multiplayer choosing 5 players @ the start, can designate human or computer controls for each.

start menu , choose name, length of game, and starting cash of players


u dont have to rewrite it line for line, just the spirit of it. 
mostly interbank trading, interest rates, taxes, stock trading, company formation , bank/insurance management, news ticker affecting prices, stock filter, financial statements etc. 
we will start writing it in the cli , but can use opengl/glut for visualazations later.
