 Summary of Completed Work:

   1. Fixed duplicate fclose in view.c - Resolved the duplicate file closure issue
   2. Expanded UI Library with canvas element support - Added canvas element with proper rendering that doesn't interfere
      with other UI elements
   3. Added menu and menuitem elements - Implemented menu system with proper rendering and interaction
   4. Improved modular system - Enhanced the external module communication system with better error handling and
      implemented the incrementing value functionality
   5. Created comprehensive demo project - Updated the demo to showcase all features including dynamic UI updates
   6. Refined parser for better error handling and efficiency - Added unique ID support for better element identification
      and improved parsing robustness

  Key Features Implemented:

   - Dynamic UI Updates: Modules can now update UI elements in real-time with proper display refresh
   - Unique Element IDs: Elements can now be identified by unique IDs instead of hardcoded positions or names
   - Improved Module Communication: Module system now properly increments values and updates the UI
   - Complete UI Library: Added canvas, menu, and menuitem elements to the existing UI components
   - Robust Parsing: Better error handling and efficiency in the C-HTML parser

  The framework is now capable of running complete applications with separate .c and .chtml files using the MVC
  interpreter architecture, as you mentioned as the ultimate goal. The dynamic UI update capability demonstrates that
  the system can support real-time interactions between modules and the UI, similar to how web applications work with
  HTTP servers.
