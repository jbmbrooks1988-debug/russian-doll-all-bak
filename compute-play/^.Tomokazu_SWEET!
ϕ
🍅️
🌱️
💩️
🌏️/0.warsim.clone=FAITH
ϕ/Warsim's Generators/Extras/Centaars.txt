------ CENTAAR RACE CODE ----------
You can put this in the RaceType.txt file in Warsim's data folder to add them
back into the world, they use elven faces.

Centaars.1.0.0.0.60.4.Centaar.60.Centaarian Hunter.135.Centaarian Champion.165.known as half-elf half-horse these creatures are fast and aggressive

------ WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ------
Centaars are half-elf half-horse, the elven version of a Centaur (half-man)
It was an original creation invented for the warsim world, like Blogroki
Skeeroks, Protofolk, and so on, however as of update 0.7.5.3 the concept of
completely procedural 'taur' races rendered Centaars useless as the taur
system made random taur versions of every race including elves.

It made more sense to leave it up to randomness than to have hardcoded versions
of them so now instead of Centaars you can find Elvetaurs, Goblintaurs, Trolltaurs
and so on.

I have saved the code for the Centaar race so if anyone wants to put them back
in they can!
