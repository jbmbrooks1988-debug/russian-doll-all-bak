These are the faces of the old golems, added who knows when an removed 29/07/2020

It had been a long time coming but after coming up with a new viable replacement for them
and realising that the golem face gen was the smallest of all the games face generators
I figured it as good a time as any to replace them.

-------REINSTALLING OLD GOLEM FACES--------------------------------------------------------
You can however at any time reinstall these old golem faces by going to your warsim folder
and finding Data/Faces directory, these 7 files contain the different face parts.

Search for the number 24. which indicates golem faces, and replace the current ones with the
relevant ones from the file, put the ones from GolemFaces0.txt into Face0.Txt etc

You must remove the current lines with 24. next to them though, or paste the replacements 
over them or otherwise your 'golems' will be the merged versions of the two types resulting
in some abominations
