Welcome, you should have a go at drumming.
I saw a goblin snap his finger on a drum once, hit it at a very strange angle.
Ever seen a drum hit so hard it breaks?
Many come here dreaming of drumming for a living, but few have the dedication and the right mindset for it.
Do you think I could be a good drummer? I dream of it.
I'm training to be a proper drummer, one day, I hope.
Me not the worst drummer.
You don't look like the average drummer.
I like hitting things, used to hit other goblins but now just hit drums.
Have you played the drums, such a fun instrument, a lot of anger you can let out.
Have a little practice on the drums in the lobby if you want.
This school produces some of the greatest goblin drummers known.
I will be the best drummer Goblinwood has ever seen!
Me good drummer.
My advice to young goblins is the same, save up some scraps of gold and take the best lessons you can, use this knowledge to perform in public and keep working on it, pay for better lessons and grow.
Welcome to the Goblinwood School of Drums.
Welcome to the drum school, friend.
I've been to both the Musician's Guild and the School of Drums and for a goblin, the School of Drums is the far superior choice.
Here better than music guild in Songwood, here better for goblin, less trouble.
I come from different place than Goblinwood, only here to learn to drum.
I remember it now, here this is a good little rhythm I have learned, fast tap twice and a standard hit, try it on the drums here, [1 1 4 on a goblin drum set]
Take lessons here if you can't drum, it's easy.
I am still perfecting my tic toc tap.
I am getting better but still much more to learn.
Want to know a small rhythm you can play repeatedly [you are shown a small page with notes on playing drums on it and the following '1 1 2 - 1 1 4 and repeat']
In a few years I'll be the best drummer in all of Goblinwood!
