Dunewarriors like to fight, and water is wet!
Come to watch us brawl have you stranger? Pull up a rock and watch.
I'm itching for a fight, can't wait till it's my turn
You're not a Dunewarrior, not often we find outsiders among us.
Fight like hell and then drink away the pain, that's the Dunewarrior way.
What are you looking at outsider!
If you can't hold your own in a brawl you aren't a true Dunewarrior.
I don't have much to say, we Dunewarrior's aren't ones for talk.
Talk talk talk, I'm here to watch a fight outsider! Don't you understand?
Where's that one eyed pipsqueak Clarence the Hood, always shifting around the dunes but never whenever we are around.
Hail to the Dunelord, and no one else.
I met a traveller who told me the Dunelands were a savage place, I disagree, I just think he was a coward... That's why I knocked him out.
Dunesand is perfect for patching up a bloody wound, unrelatedly a staggering amount of our cuts are getting infected.
My dream in life is to knock someones tooth out in a fight, by Dunelaw it'll legally be mine and I can forge it onto a ring.
If you can't brawl then you might as well not be alive.
A life of fighting is a life worth living, that's what I believe.
We Dunewarriors are a proud and fierce people, we live for battle and glory. To us, fighting is the sincerest form of expression!
We prefer to let our fists do the talking.
