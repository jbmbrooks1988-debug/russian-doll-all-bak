We do not allow our troops to pass into the armies of tyrants or dictators
I joined up years ago after hearing the name, the order of the roses, it's quite beautiful
Our knights are unmatched in the field
Sometimes brothers from the citadel go to fight in the arena, almost always come back victorious
The home of an empire once this place, I can see why
We don't get a lot of trouble here in songwood, we've made sure of it
Under our protection songwood has flourished
We get the odd unright, trying to cause problems or challenging us to fights, but it never ends well for them
Went to visit a few of my brothers in the old songwood graveyard, so many graves, it seems almost infinite
I like to visit the musicians guild on my off time, wonderful place, you should see it
I've never seen anyone human beat a holy order champion in a fair fight, gods even in unfair fights its an odd sight
I remember it now, a band of goblins had come to songwood to raid, 40 or so of them, It was myself and my trainee knight who encountered them, they were armoured with some kind of pig-iron gear, but they had sharp daggers and pronged arrows tipped with some kind of poison, we were near a small outhang when they charged us, nowhere to run, but a thin softwood tree beside us gave me an idea, I swung my blade into the tree and toppled it, it was fairly thin, about twice my arm in size and maybe twice my height, picked it up and wielded it, now this was a struggle, the trainee helped me, we held it up and at the last moment when most of the goblins charged forth we swung the felled tree into them knocking at least 30 of them off the edge of the overhang, the rest ran away, my proudest moment
This is where champions and heroes are made my friend, mark my words
You've come to the right place if you want to be protected by the best fighters in the world
It's a magnificent citadel, one of the grandest buildings in the west, if not the most
I came here for glory and by gods I found it
I will be with the holy order til death, as will my children
We train knights here but you cannot hire Holy Order Champions, unfortunately we are the most powerful
We are an unmatched force, tread with caution friend
I am priviliged to have joined the order
Long live the Order!
Songwood owes it's peace to us
Long live the order! Long live the order!
I joined last year, I have trained so much with the order I have become incomparable to who I was
The order of the roses has the toughest army in the realm hands down
Long live the mighty Holy Order of the Roses
Saw a drunkard once challenge one of us to a duel, only the drunkard had two swords and my friend had no weapon, as you can imagine, the drunkard was killed within seconds, a quick snap of his neck... the order is unstoppable
The order is the only thing keeping this realm together, without us it would fall into ruin
We are the best of the best, if you want to join us you have to prove your worth
There are two types of people in this world, those who live under the protection of the Holy Order, and those who don't
I have been training with the Order for years, I am now one of the best fighters in the realm
I joined up when I was younger, I wanted to be one of the best fighters in the realm
The Order of the Roses is the most powerful force in the west
