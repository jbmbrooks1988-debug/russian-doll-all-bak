Welcome to the camp friend, I hope you enjoy your time with us
Hello
Welcome friend
I hope you are enjoying your trip here
Come back here anytime!
Hi
Hail my good friend, how are you?
Hello lovely one!
Hugs are underrated
Everyone should just be nice to each other, the world would be better
Everyone was once a baby, some people are mean and cruel but they would never think of doing it to a baby, but an aged baby they see no issue with insulting, we are all children
I feel so happy today
I feel a little bit down today, but it's ok because tomorrow is another day
I love Songwood
I love you
I love our leader Maclean, he's a kind soul
I love these lands
I love the trees around here
I love going to the musicians guild and listening to them making music
I love strolling through the old graveyard and admiring the echoes of the past
I love passing by the Citadel of the Order and seeing the magnificent structures built by man
I love visiting the Oooh snake sanctuary and seeing the lovely little slitherers
I love passing by old Mr Yaeba's house, he's a generous man
Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my tent's co-ordinates, so send a raven
I love meeting new people, I bet you're interesting and have many stories that would facinate me
I love knowing that no matter how things go, there's always tomorrow
I felt alone, I had been alone for a long time, and when you're alone for a long time you begin to feel and process the feeling of isolation, it can make you depressed but also ignorant of the clear reason for those feelings, but switching things up, making sure you are your own best friend and ensuring you have time to meet and love new people, is the most surefire way to a peaceful freedom that I know
I love the smell of the forest
I love the sound of the river
I love the way the sun shines through the leaves
I love nature
I love life
I love the trees around here, they're so tall and green
I hope you have a great day!
I love spending time with my friends and family
I love exploring new places
I love learning new things
I love spending time outdoors
I love spending time with animals
I love spending time in nature
I love exploring the ancient ruins and imagining what life was like for the people who lived there
