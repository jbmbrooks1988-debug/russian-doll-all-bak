Hail friend, we are the merry leafburners
We smoke and smoke and choke and choke... *coughs*
I like the leaf because it makes me feel nice, but it makes me get fatter and work less, and in a peasant economy those are not good traits to gain, it's a juxtaposition but the stress and hardship of the peasant life is not an easy one
Welcome to the guildhall... *starts laughing*
I'm sorry I can't speak right now, I don't feel able
*Cough*
What's that song we sometimes sing, I forgot it
What will we do if the leaf supply gets cut off here
Do you ever feel like a random briefly appearing character in a procedurally generated videogame, no? ok
Uh oh, I smoked way more of that leaf than I thought
I dont smoke much, just when I need a rest
I love this leaf so much
I hate the magic purple leaf, I burn every bit that I find
Better than ale this stuff is
Leaf me alone... see what I did there... cause leaf, sounds like leave... no... ok
The leaf is our friend, and we will never turn our backs on it, no matter what happens.
I like the leaf because it makes me feel nice
We are the merry leafburners, We smoke and smoke and choke and choke
