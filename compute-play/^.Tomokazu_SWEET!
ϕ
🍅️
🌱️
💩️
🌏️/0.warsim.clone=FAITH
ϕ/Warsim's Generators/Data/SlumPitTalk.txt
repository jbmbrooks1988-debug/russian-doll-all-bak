Nothing much to do around here, watching people punch each others brains out is fun
I wish I could fight like these guys, can you imagine
Sometimes the guards come down to watch the fights, no one cares, these are slumfolk after all
Some of these fights get out of hand, but no one stops them
Seen people die in fights down here, it's an inconvenience but no one is surprised
What? never seen the slum pit before?
I prefer coming and sitting here in the slums than going to the fighters district
Some of these folk could do so much with themselves if they weren't always fighting
Did you see that last fight?
I wish we could bet on fights here, I've been getting good at calling them
I'm so glad this is free, not like that fight pit in the fighters district
Nothing like a good bit of tooth bashing to start your day
Fight fight fight fight!
Keep looking at me and we'll have to pop into that pit ourselves eh?
I wish I wasn't poor, but at least we have our own fighting pit
Who knew a hole in the ground could be so lively thanks to a bunch of violent slumfolk
People are so afraid of getting punched in the face, but if you're expecting it the rush of adrenaline helps you deal with it
I used to fight in these when I was younger, sometimes wish I hadn't though
POKE HIM IN THE EYES! KICK HIS SHINS!
It's so exciting to watch people fight each other, especially when they're equally matched. There's nothing like seeing two people punch each other until one of them falls down
It's not much fun around here when you're not watching people punch each others brains out
What? You want to fight too?
It's brutal and sometimes people die, but that's just part of the fun for the spectators
