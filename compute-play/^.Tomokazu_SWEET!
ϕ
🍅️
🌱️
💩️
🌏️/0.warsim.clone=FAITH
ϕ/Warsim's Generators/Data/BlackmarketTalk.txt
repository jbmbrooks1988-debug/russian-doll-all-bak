0.I wish I lived somewhere other than this Blackmarket, the place is filthy
0.Leave if you can, this is a place of injustice
0.If you don't want trouble, avoid the slums, dockrow, blackrow, the fighters district, and central district, basically just keep to guildrow
0.Every 100 years the market has a big celebration, the Century Festival they call it, wonderful even
0.The Blackmarket is a magical place truth be told, lots going on here
0.There are lots of districts to check out here
0.Rumour has it the man who sells that magic fruit in the market stalls gets it from the sewers
0.Welcome to the Blackmarket friend
0.The Blackmarket is without a doubt the most interesting place in the north, perhaps all the lands
1.For a while I swear I could hear the bustle of the market even when the streets were empty, strange
1.Avoid the slums if you can... bad place
1.Watch out near the fight pit here, nasty place
1.The slums used to be the main part of the market, now it's a useless appendage
1.One day I'll live in guildrow
1.I hate the slums, we've got slavers and scum always snooping around
1.There's always local scum and folk looking for work here
1.Them hired scum work for cheap, only thing cheaper are slaves I think
1.Have you seen that old wizard tower, they say it was a wizard who ruled the market before us but I wasn't alive then
1.It's funny, that wizards tower was the home once of the first Blackmarket ruler, and now it's some rubble in the most deprived and forgotten district of the market
1.That wizards tower gives me the spooks
1.Them slavers are hated around here but they are protected by the market
1.Almost got caught by a slaver here once, broke his nose and ran away
1.Slumfolk have to watch for slavers around here, scum the lot of them
1.See that well over there, a horrid creature lives inside it
1.Do not try answering the riddles of chelob the well beast for they are impossible to guess
1.Chelob is a strange thing, he won't hurt anyone though but some are afraid of him
1.Only person in the slums that is worthy of not being in the slums is Niklas the bug hunter, he has saved us many a time
1.That bug hunters hut makes me feel safe, we have some strange insects around
1.I walked past that smoking hut once and got a headache immediately
1.That hut is always billowing smoke from its roof
1.The slums are a hardy place to live, only place worse would be Blackrow I would say
1.I long to move to another district, say Guildrow or even the docks
1.I work selling junk in the market over at the Central district, one day I will be free of this scumhole
1.Some people get really angry at chelob when they fail, I think his questions are impossible personally, it's funny to watch, everyone has tried
1.Slumfolk are untrusting people what with ruffian pickpockets, slavers and bandits a plenty
1.I hate living here
1.If I could go somewhere better than here I would do it in a flash
1.I got pickpocketed the other day... my last and only gold coin... I hate the slums
1.I don't actually mind the slums, if you can look past some of it's issues its not a bad area
1.I want to train to be a pit fighter, if I win some fights I can pay my way out of the slums
1.Seen men starve around here, the slums are a rough place
1.I don't know if I'd prefer that evil wizard who used to live in the tower over there to be in charge instead of the bandits
1.Some people donate money to the slums, I wouldn't if I had money I'd run with it
1.This district is smelly
1.I'm not from the slums, I'm actually just visiting a friend here, don't think I'll ever visit again though
1.What are you looking at, never seen slum scum before
1.Come to watch us wallow in our poverty outsider?
1.I want out... the slums are a horrible place
1.The slums aren't so bad if you're not an idiot, unfortunately most are
2.I swear, I'm not a pickpocket
2.I like taking coins from peoples pockets, with them I can buy apples!
2.I wish I could pick pockets like some of the other boys
2.me am learn-ding words from Chelob
2.Chelob is my friend
2.I was playing in the well with Chelob earlier
2.We play by the big wizard tower sometimes
2.The wizards tower is fun to climb
2.I fell climbing the wizards tower earlier and hurt my bum
2.I was playing earlier but a big boy came and hit me with a stick
2.I was stickfighting earlier but I hurt my arm
2.Sometimes the bug hunter man gives us treats, I like beetle on a stick the most
2.the bug hunter man gives us treats sometimes, I like roasted snails the most
3.Dockrow is a good place truth be told, we get rowdy sometimes but it's all good natured
3.I hate pirates, problem is that there's a lot of them around here
3.Love the smell of the salty sea, the rotten wood and the scurvy dockworkers in the air
3.The docks are a great place to live to be honest, eventful but not over the top like some places
3.Some of these dockworkers are thieves, watch them!
3.I don't know why people eat at Mag's the smell of the building alone is enough to put me off food for a day
3.I ate at Mag's once and almost died
3.They say if you gaze upon the face of Mag the cook too long you will throw up
3.Mag's kitchen really is the worst place, mostly hungry slum folk come through here to eat, most locals won't touch the place
3.I don't see the fuss with Mag's of course I lost my sense of taste and smell in an accident, but still, it seems alright
3.Save yourself trouble and avoid Mag's soup kitchen if you can
3.Some people talk badly of Mag's but after a long day at sea or work, some of the tamer things on her menu go down a treat
3.I eat at Mag's all the time, best thing is the mystery mash in my opinion
3.Ever had Rat-Hide and Dustweed broth? it's a local favourite you can get down at Mag's
3.As a local, let me give you a tip, if you eat at Mag's, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT order the Bloody-Rag Soup, most people who do end up violently ill within an hour of eating the damned soup
3.That beast of a woman Mag tried to kiss me once, I feel sick now even thinking about it
3.I hear singing all the time coming from that Black Opal ship
3.Sometimes if you visit the Black Opal when it's docked you can listen to their singing, they will charge you to watch though
3.That rare tomes shop is often closed, the owner only sells to high end clientelle
3.Rumor has it there is a magical artifact somewhere in this district, some have said it's on one of the ships, another said that goblin has it but I reckon it's Aehlan, the rare tomes seller
3.Have you heard, people say there is a magical artifact around here, an infinite bag of gold I heard
3.I wonder what kind of books that tome shop has, I can't read unfortunately
3.I miss the Count's Arms, that's what happens when the guards don't do their jobs
3.Without the Count's Arms most people head to Blackrow, luckily the Blackrow tavern is right by the entrance so you don't have a chance to get lost in that horrible place
3.I don't drink much now that the Count's Arms was destroyed, The Dragon's Kneecap in Guildrow is too expensive and the Blackrow tavern in Blackrow is too dangerous
3.Ever read the Black Wall, interesting stuff
3.Dockrow has a lot going on within it, we've got ships, history, hat makers, books, seers and so on
3.I'm glad the Count's Arms is gone, less rowdy drunks about
3.I think if we didn't have a watchtower here there would be more trouble
3.Some of those hats in the Hatmaker's Shop are very odd

3.I work for the East Dock Company, it's good work
3.That hall of goblin heroes is an interesting place, most people have seen it at least once
3.I don't like goblins but I didn't know about their heroes, makes them seem more like us
3.That hall of goblin heroes shouldn't be here, this isn't a goblin settlement, we don't care about goblin history
3.All sorts of interesting ships dock here all the time, keep your eye out
3.The East Dock Company have made some folk very rich
3.My friends and I have been investing in some business ventures with the East Dock Company, sometimes we get really lucky
3.That East Dock Company is one of the main employers in this district, the other main employer is the group of idiots that always try and steal from it hahahaha
3.I work for the East Dock Company, loading goods to and from their boats

5.Sometimes the Wild Skalds band come and play in the Dragon's Kneecap

5.If you ask nicely the Musician's Guild will let you play and practice on their instruments
5.I'm one of the member's of the Musician's Guild, you should swing by some time it's a great place to be
5.I love Guildrow but those damned musician's are always making a racket
5.Some people complain but I like the Musician's Guild, it's nice to hear music every so often
5.Yes, I am a musician, I try not to brag... but I am pretty good
5.Sometimes we get theives who come to Guildrow to case the Treasury, none have ever successfully robbed it though
5.Guildrow is safe, they even keep all the treasure here

5.Hall of Zoology, it's an interesting place if you want to learn about animals

5.There is no place like Guildrow, so much to do
5.Do you like Guildrow, it really is the nicest part of this terrible place
5.I often wonder what the market would be like if Guildrow weren't here to keep it from falling into real darkness
5.I hate leaving Guildrow, the rest of the market feels so unsafe
5.Want to see the biggest nose in the realm, go to the Herald office and look at their Chief-Editor, Edmunds nose is bigger than an elephants trunk hahahaha
5.If you're a cheapskate like me you can get a free read of the newspaper by heading to the Blackmarket Herald Office
5.I'm not from here, I just come to drink in the Dragon's Kneecap, it's the nicer of the taverns in the Blackmarket
