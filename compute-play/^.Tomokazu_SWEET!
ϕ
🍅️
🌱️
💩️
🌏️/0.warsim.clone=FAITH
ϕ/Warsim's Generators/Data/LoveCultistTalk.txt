How are you today
It's ok to feel upset sometimes, because sadness just like happiness is like a passing rain cloud, it won't last longer than a season
Smile, even if you don't feel like it, force yourself, if you've ever heard fake it til you make it, it's true, your mind is tricked into thinking you're happier and makes it so
You are loved
Somewhere, someone is wishing for world peace or is saying that they love everyone in the whole world, I hope you appreciate it
For some people today will be the best day of their lives, millions will be having their first kiss today, many babies will be taking their first breath, what a wonderful time to be alive
If you're feeling a little bit down, nature is always a good way to unwind, I was sceptical at first but go and sit in the sun on a beach or a patch of grass, it's like natures healing ray
Sometimes our diet is related to our emotions, if you feel low and notice your diet is very poor, what have you got to lose by substituting a few things for healthier alternatives
While this isn't a solution for everyone, sometimes going for a run or doing physical excersize can increase mood
It's a pleasure to meet you
I know I am but a blip in this world, but I really am glad that you are reading this, know that you are appreciated!
Don't take things too seriously friend, we are a momentary burst of life on a large watery rock flying through the universe, nothing more
Sometimes the idea of a happy place sounds silly, but try it, challenge yourself to think of all of your happiest memories and choose one to be the best
No one is truly evil, very few people wake up and say, today I will be as evil as I can, most people are doing what they think is right
A smile is worth one thousand frowns
Isn't it amazing how much more attractive people look when they smile or laugh
Those of us who give the least love likely need the most
You are never alone as long as you are kind to yourself
You are important and special!
