1.Wulf is the greatest bard ever
1.The blackmarket isn't so receptive to music as other places, too much evil here
1.I'd love to be able to play in one of the taverns here, preferably the dragon's kneecap cause it's closer and not in a district full of darkness
1.Ever heard Wulf Thorenson in the central district? the boy is an amazing musician
1.Wulf Thorenson's a fraud, he can barely hold his lute but he's been buying a musicians elixir from the market stalls and has used it to enhance his ability, it's magic not skill!
1.This guild is a smaller one but head to songwood in the west just beyond 
1.This guild isn't as good as the main hall in Songwood
1.Wulf Thorenson is the greatest musician in the land I would wager
1.Welcome to the Musicians guild
1.Welcome to our humble guildhall!
2.I hear of this Wulf, supposedly the best musician alive? I'll believe it when I see it
2.Welcome to the Musicians Guildhall, the hub of music
2.We have another guild in the blackmarket too but this is our main hall
2.Speak to the guildmaster if you have questions
2.You should visit the songwood trees sometime, good place to clear your mind
2.If you tip and treat bards well you will end up with a lot more of them coming to see you
2.If you treat bards well more of them will visit your lands
2.Only well reputed friends of the guild can go through that door over there

2.I like it here in songwood, sometimes I head over to the great trees and listen to the birds sing
