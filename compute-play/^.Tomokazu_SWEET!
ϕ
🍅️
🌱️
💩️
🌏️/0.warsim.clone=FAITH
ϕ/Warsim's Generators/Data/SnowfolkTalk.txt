Them big mountains, we call them the three brothers, they watch over us
The three brothers are in my dreams almost every night
We must stay humble in the gaze of the three brothers, and stay ever vigilant
The three brothers are troubled, I hear the winds that roar past the mountains and they carry the sound of trouble
The three brothers will watch over us
Each man in the village builds a spear which surrounds the village perimeter, each has his name on it, there are many from our ancestors all around
I am so proud of my spear
It is customary for us Snowfolk to train with spears, we use them to hunt and to defend, though we aren't often bothered by outsiders
I will never be more than arms reach from my spear
No weapon better than a spear
Our huts foundations are strong and thick, keeping the cold out from under us
I love my hut
I never thought we'd get any visitors here
We all long to leave the village, but we never would, such a thing would be foolish
We have a few words for cold here, cold, very-cold, and so cold your balls are falling off... hahahahaha
Well I never, foreigners... here?
They say southern folks poo is soft and squidgey, unlike our hard nuggets, strange folk they are
We are experts at hut building here, they have to be able to protect us from the damned cold
I enjoy the cold, we have been moulded by it for generations
Any snowfolk who cant stand the cold aren't snowfolk
Do not mistake us for some weak wilderfolk, the snowfolk spearmen are feared northwide
Not much to do here so we mostly polish each others spears, in fact that's all we ever do
Not many venture this far north, madmen mostly, sometimes poets, once a very confused trader
I can count on my hand the number of foreign folk I've seen in my life
A foreigner, strange times indeed that you are here
It's a simple life, but what more could we want
They say south of here the land is green with plants of eating... it sounds like a paradise that could make men soft
They say in the south, folk can wander around with their skin bare in the wind, I cannot imagine this
We are humble folk, but do not confuse us with weak folk, even our old are handy with a spear
The three brothers are always watching over us, we must stay ever vigilant
Dress warmly and always be on the lookout for danger
You are welcome here, foreigner, but beware - the cold can be deadly if you're not careful
