My big brother joined the group so I followed, we ain't that bad we just take gold from folk sometimes
I'm proud to be a bandit, alone we might be killed for rejecting the rule of law, but together we resist
I don't rob lowly peasants as a rule, me father was a farmer and I know how terrible being robber would be for a man of his wealth and standing
I know it sounds bad but I prefer robbing the low folk, they don't resist as much, try telling an armoured knight with a sword the size of a tree trunk to hand you his coin purse and see how it goes
Worst raid I ever went on we lost half our number, damned goblin warband had the same idea as us and we both met, we killed more of them than we lost but it was still devastating
I always wanted to be a bandit, but now I am one they aren't fearsome monsters, mostly broken men
I was kicked out of my village as a youth for fighting, It wasn't my fault but the elder was a rotten egg, well years later I took a raiding party back and took his head, hahaha, who is heading down a bad path now Elder Norton!
I was being held prisoner by a group of goblins, these lot freed me so I joined up with them
Better to be an outlaw in a pack than an outlaw out on his own, and so here I am
I don't mind moving with a smaller group, that Phenor guy scares me
Once you're in you don't betray your brothers, it doesn't happen often but it ain't pretty what we do to traitors around here
Would you believe I used to be a town guard haha
Everyone from my village becomes a bandit, sort of a little tradition of ours
My father was a bandit here, and so am I
Worst injury I ever had in a fight was from a farmer's pitchfork, the bastard didn't want to give up his coin purse without a fight, jabbed me right in my chest with it and I was wounded for three weeks
What, never seen a bandit before, stop judging me!
Best place for bandits to drink is the Thickblood Tavern
You know what, people think it's hard being an outlaw but truth is there are plenty of places we can go, Blackmarket, Thickblood tavern, tons of places
I don't rob children, that's my only rule
Ooh I hate guards, lost many friends to them
I cut the hand off the last guard who tried to bring me in
I ain't going to the dungeons, I know what happens to men in there
I've killed a few in my time but I take no pleasure in it
Nothing I love more than murder, some of the boys here are soft but not me, I'll kill anyone
Killed two farmers on the road last week, thought they'd be brave, now they're dead
You lose a lot of brothers as a bandit, not as safe as living behind them fancy walls
You look familiar, have I ever held you for ransom?
Imagine the gold I'd get for capturing someone like you, hahaha
It's been too long since we've had a good raid
Can't remember the last time we sacked a caravan, I'm getting bored
We need to find a new place to hide out, the guards are getting too close
I was born to be a bandit, it's in my blood
Being a bandit ain't easy, you gotta be tough and mean to survive
I joined up with the bandits because I was looking for adventure, and this is the most exciting thing I've ever done!
I used to work as a hired thug for a local noble, but I got sick of taking orders so I joined up with these guys
I come from a long line of bandits, it's in my blood
I was born to be a bandit, it's all I've ever wanted to do
My parents were bandits, my grandparents were bandits, it's just what we do
I'm not a bad person, I just do what I have to do to survive
I know it's not right, but I can't help myself, I'm a bandit
I don't care what you think of me, I'm a bandit and I'm proud of it
