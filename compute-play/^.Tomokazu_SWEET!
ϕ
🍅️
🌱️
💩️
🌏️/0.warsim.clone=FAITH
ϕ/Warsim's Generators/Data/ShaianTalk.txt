The Coastal King makes me feel happy, a king who is true acts in the interest of even the smallest of his people
You should meet the coastal king, important traveller like yourself, I'm sure he'd love to hear your wisdom
The Coastal King has been in power for longer than I can remember, good man
I probably shouldn't say this but I was reading a book the other day about words and it mentioned 'Immortal' meaning something that lives forever, well I' been thinking about it and I've never seen mention of a previous coastal king in our entire history
Welcome to Shaian friend
Always a pleasure to find a traveler here
Never thought I'd see a foreign man with my own eyes, the pleasure is all mine
Do you like my hat, it's made of coral
Ever been to Nalli trading post? it's just outside of town, they are good folk, maybe you can trade with them
I love Shaian, but the mages district is a no go for me, I don't like to dabble with magic
The tower of Onia in the mages district, what secrets does it hold? I must know
They say the tower of Onia existed before Shaian did, could that be true?
I've been having a strange recurring dream recently, a coastman like myself, with no eyes... sitting on a blue pillow whispering the word mystery to me... what does it mean
Nothing fills me with confidence more than seeing someone in a set of royal coastal armour, it's just so majestic
The Shaian tavern, that's my favorite spot
We do not get visitors from far very often, welcome to you, traveller
I could not imagine living anywhere but here, Shaian is the best
I love pearl diving, it's an easy hobby, there are pearls everywhere here
Ever been to the Shaian tavern? you should it's a nice place
Swampy cup game is my favorite passtime
Ever played the swampy cup game, it's such fun
The Shaian tavern is simple, it doesn't flash itself up and sells cheap ale, it's the only place worth drinking
I hope you're enjoying your trip to Shaian so far
You're welcome back anytime friend, a friend of the coastal folk is a friend for life
How's Shaian treating you friend
I welcome any new comers to our land, enjoy! there is plenty of good to go around
We coastal folk have existed for a long time in these parts
Once many years ago, a bold young man swore to explore the northern stretch, the place you come from, he said it hadn't been done before and it ought to be, some were worried that it would bring danger back to the coast, but the coastal king gave the boy his blessing, a good ship and twenty heavily armoured men, well the ship voyaged far to the north-west and ended up in a bog, we'd never seen anything like it, awful plants with violent tendencies, grotesque slimy creatures, he didn't meet with too much violence though and met with a creature identifying itself as the swamp king, in exchange for a coastal blade the swamp king gave him some mushroom spores, the boy and his men returned as heroes bringing with them the mushroom spores that grew into the great mushrooms that can be found near the docks, and sharing with us the swampy cup game that the folks of the boglands played, adventure done well I'd say, but since then no one has felt the need to go north
We coastal folk are said to have come from the northern lands, but settled here, we have had no bother since
We hear horrible things happen beyond our wall, dreaded northern lands full of monsters and beasts, though we are happy here I do have some slight fear that one day we will be undone by them
The Wizards of the coast build a protective wall between us and the northern lands, we are safe
Ever seen a coastal man in heavy armour, scary stuff, I'd hate to fight us
Bought my wife a lovely shell the other day from the shell stall, I find it fascinating that these are lived in by little sea creatures
Seen the Pearl Wall yet in the fighting coastman, it's a marvel of our greatest gift, pearls
Fighting coastman, best tavern around
We've got two taverns in Shaian, both are good
Put a pearl on the giant mushroom this morning, I love tradition
That giant mushroom is a little bit smelly, still it's good to experience bad smells, makes the good smells that much better
The kings district is a grand place and the coastal king welcomes all
The Shaian dungeons are a relic these days, apparently we used to have a bit of a pirate problem, no more though
I would say they ought to knock those dungeons down, but a bit of culture doesn't hurt
I don't go into the mage district, they are far too important to have us bothering them
The Nerego Mapmakers are avid explorers, a group founded by the man who set sail for the north all those years ago
Barkeep, here's a tip for you my good man, I hope you are enjoying things as much as I
Well I've had my little ritual drink, off to bed now I think
Ever go for a nice beach stroll at night, a wondrous feeling
The Northern lands are a scary concept, they talk of demons
Are there still Demons to the north my friend?
So is it all swamp up north?
A friend of mine claims that there's an island down south held by a wizard? gone rogue from Shaian perhaps
T'was a shame what happened to the coastal galleon, a storm, usually storms are fun, offer a bit of variety, no matter, we can still admire the ships beauty
Did you hear, our biggest ship was wrecked in a storm, such a shame
The local shipwrights aren't very good, they can't fix up the Galleon, it's not a big deal though, in reality sailing is more for pleasure than for need, we could be land bound and still happy
Ever had a good little swim, you can see clearly through the water, it's a treat
I found a crab on my doorstep this morning, put the little feller back on the beach
We take only what we need here, most coastmen have few possessions but enjoy each of them immensely until they break, then they spend a great deal of time replacing them
We sure use the word coast a lot don't we
Hello there, won't bore you I've little to say, but welcome to Shaian regardless
That's one of our pearls, a natural wonder
The Shaian docks are a beautiful place
Have you seen the Shaian docks? they are stunning
We have some of the best oysters in the world here
The oysters here are said to be the best in the world, I believe it
The oysters in Shaian are among the best I've ever had
I love oysters, they are my favorite food
The oysters here are the best I have ever tasted
I could eat oysters all day
The oysters here are so good
The oysters in Shaian are the best I've ever tasted
