I fought in pits and arenas, not always winning but always getting back up
Not an eventful past at all I'm afraid, lots of scrubbing
I was born in a far off realm, sent here by my parents before our home was destroyed, now I am the last of my people, and defend all those in need of help
Huh, what? Where am I? H-How'd I get here? oh um I guess, I'm an adventurer now?

Remember the orc horde that was tearing up the southwestern area of the land few months back? No? Well, I took care of that, No one ever sees me doing the cool stuff

My family were rich merchants, Though they were only rich from scams they ran, When I found out, I ran away as a young boy, and never returned
They once thought I was the son of a famous and powerful king, when they found out I wasn't who my mother claimed I was, they threw me out of their kingdom, and left me for the wolves, Well, I killed those wolves, And I would kill them too, if I ever got the chance
When I was a young boy, I was taken on a boat ride to a land far away from mine, I didn't understand at the time, But they eventually trained me to be a great warrior, They said they had to take me to a place where I knew no one, because having people I care about would only hold me back
I once slayed an army of over one thousand dragons with my bare fists, I'm telling you, I'm no liar!
I like to fish, as well as destroy kingdoms

I was a baby and had the choice between a rattle and a sword, I chose the sword, been fighting ever since
I come from a fighting school, my prowess surpassing all of my peers
I blacked out one night and killed a man in cold blood, I fight to try and regain my lost honor
My father was a champion, and his father was a champion, and his father was a champion, and his father was a champion, and his father was a champion, and his father was a champion, and his father was a champion, and his father was a disappointment
I've killed thousands of household pests in my lifetime, That must equate to at least 8 men, right?

I escaped from the belly of a whale, that's probably the most eventful part of my life at sea
I was a beggar before I was enlisted into the royal army, being a soldier saved my life, I'm proud to call myself a champion
I used to be a doctor, but I've realized the best place to practice medicine is on the battlefield
Y-you realize this world isn't real right? We're in some kind of twisted game! Everybody thinks I'm crazy, but it's true! W-what's do you mean you're the one playing it?
My mum and pa were turned into toads by a witch, I found er' and cut er' bloody head clean off
I was born a noble and have been living off of my passed father's wealth for years now, Now that it's all dried up, I've to pay for the wenches some how!
*The man speaks in a language that neither you nor any translator can understand*
I'm was an author who wanted to get a better sense of what battle was like, The fighting thing just kind of stuck with me though
The gods made me a killing machine, I'm made to kill!
I was born in a farming community but decided to leave, You have no clue how boring being a farmer is
I'm a cannibal, I hope you don't mind the corpses of your enemies being my brunch
I'm a jester looking for jokes, I figured I might find some new material here
My past? Hell if I can remember, I can hardly remember what I ate for dinner last night, It was pork I think
I was raised by goblins, I think their unique fighting style of "hit the enemy as hard as you can and flee for your life" will be a great asset
I was a soldier in a far off land, 'ave been since the age of 5, Wound to the chest got me discharged but that's all healed, right n' good
I used to be a blacksmith's apprentice, but I decided making swords was a lot less fun than using them
I was the royal guard of a king in a far off kingdom but that kingdom is no more unfortunately, and neither is the king
A notorious thief looked after me and other orphans, and I spied and stole to earn my keep
I am just a druid from a desert with a drinking problem
Im a writer experiencing writers block, I thought this might help
Im someone who hasn't accomplished anything in their short life
I would rather kill you than talk about my past
I am just a normal guy who keeps getting mistaken as a famous knight
Well they say I'm a crazy madman, By the way do you know where the floating city is?
I am currently still looking for a true calling, I feel like there's more to explore in this world
I am currently looking for a place to truly call home
Who really knows
I am a duelist looking for a worthy opponent
I am just a sadistic bastard, What more do you need to know!?
Before this I was a gardener
My selfishness lead to a split with one of my lovers, she hunts me, I came here to get away from her
I had a baking business before bandits came and forced me to become a fighter
More than anything, I want to be noticed by a protagonist, Are you a protagonist?
Before I was a teacher, now I am just a soldier
I grew up in a broken family in a normal city, lived free of trouble until I was about 14 years old, but at that point life changed
I was born to a distant royal family, but my father banished me out because I was too lazy, yeah well LOOK AT ME NOW DAD!
I was a sailor but the ship I was on got wrecked, I survived by hugging a plank of wood
A dragon held me prisoner for months until adventurers killed it
I was a powerful mage in a past life, Oh you mean this life? Not important
I met a demigod and lived to tell the tale

God left me unfinished!
I was a warrior bodyguard in the court of a petty noble from a distant land but one day a witch stole his gold with a spell and he couldn't pay for my services anymore
I have no past, only future, A sorcerer stole my memories; only distant flashes and hazy visions remain in my mind

I found a magical ring in the burrow of a little rabbit, It made me powerful and strong, Pretty nice, right?
There are many evils and bad things afoot in the world and the common people of the land need heroes and mighty warriors to defend them, so I answered the call
My father was a farmer, his father was a farmer and his father's father was a farmer too, I didn't want to be a farmer like them, there is more to life than simply raising and harvesting crops, so I left home, Now my blade harvests something else
My mother gave birth to me in a battlefield and, ever since that day, I don't know anything but to fight and to wage war, I am a born warrior, a fighter, and that is what I will keep doing until I am bested by a foe or grow too old to wield and brandish my weapon
Used to be a caravan guard, and let me tell you, I saw all kinds of dangers and threats on the road, from marching tribes of raiding Goblins to great flying Dragons setting entire fields and farmlands on fire with their breath
I was born in a forest and, like my father, I was a lumberjack, cutting trees every day, Eventually I moved on to a large city and my skill with the axe made me the local executioner for a time, Trees and necks, I used to chop them all day long and I still do it, just not the trees anymore
My past days were spent in slavery, mining stone in a quarry, sometimes ore in a mine too, It made me strong, and when I was freed, I put my strength to good use in the fighting pits
I am a fighter, I fight, What else is there to know?
I followed; or rather, forced to follow; a bounty hunter for years, Learnt his trade along the way and had our differences as well, Last straw came when he hunted a questing knight for the rebels
My parents promised me to the temple before I was born, I took up arms many times, defending our monastery from outlaws, I found my taste for blood and left
Me mum's a forager and me pa's a hunter, Taught me the ways of the bow and knifes they did, Fed me long after they passed, huntin' beasts or men
I used to have my path set, Learn how to bake, find myself a wife and continue the family's business, All that changed when, well, I ran away
I was hired by a mercenary group to patch up their wounded, Fought a couple, traveled a lot, and healed many more, I was recommended to other companies when my first one disbanded, but I chose to go my own way
I used to think to myself; dead men don't need neither armor nor axe, So after the battle's over, I took what the living might need and left the dead to rest
I grew up in a family of hammers, My dad's a blacksmith, Granddad's house builder, Great granddad's shipbuilder, So when my turn comes and those dang outlaws came to visit, I just grabbed a hammer
My father used to tell me I liked to break my wooden toys, I grew up, I don't play with toys anymore, but I still like to break things, mostly people
You don't know my past? You should, I am famous and well known across many realms and kingdoms for my deeds of bravery, but don't worry, it is all recorded in a tome someday, I will have my scribe provide you with a copy
I've commanded three armies for a king in the east, ruled a fief in the name of a ruler in the south, plundered a dungeon to the west, and I single-handedly hunted a Minotaur in his underground maze in the far north
On the other side of the world I was once a king, a lord of lords, I don't mind if you don't believe it, I hated it
I have always enjoyed the stories people use to tell about heroes and brave knights, so I thought to myself that maybe I could be one too, I think I am doing pretty well so far, perhaps one day a bard will sing about me
I am called the Chosen One in the distant land where I hail from, The people say I am linked to a prophecy and that great deeds lie ahead of me
A lord hired my mercenary band to deal with bandits who kept harassing his lands and stealing from his farms, We dealt with it, because I am good and I keep my word but the same can't be said about the lord, He did not want to pay us and his men ambushed us and I am the sole survivor
I was raised in a castle, my father was a guardsman there, and I was very bright, The master of the library noticed it and allowed me to become a scribe, I learned many things, I could spend days talking about the mysteries of the stars or how to assemble a trebuchet and machines of war
I killed a warrior of my tribe in a drunken fight so my kinsmen tied me to a tree and left me to starve, but I managed to break free, Without a tribe to fight for I sold my sword to whoever paid the most instead
A spirit came to me in a dream that told me to enter the service of a great ruler to fulfil some sort of prophecy, I woke up before I found out what it was though
There was a terrible plague in my homeland, so I left so I wouldn't fall ill *cough*
My father was a great warrior and I wanted to follow in his footsteps, He died a hero, and heaven's willing so will I!
I was a jester, but a thief stole my jokebook, so I had to resort to practical humour, My slapstick was a bit too violent to be funny, but it has its uses
My past is dark, and I'd rather not bring up bad memories
I spent most of my money on wine and women and lost the rest gambling and so I couldn't pay my debts so I left town rather than face the consequences, Then I did it all again in the next town, I'm an honest man now though, if you just give me a few more chances!
My wife told me she'd leave me if I didn't get a job, so I became a caravan guard, Then she left me because I was never home
I'd tell you where I was from if I could remember, but I don't even know where I am right now
I'm a demigod sent from the heavens to bring about the world that is to come, but everyone seems to think I'm a madman for some reason, Nonetheless, the ten-thousand and twelve maggot princes squirm merrily inside my head and tell me that you are the vessel of providence, so I offer you my sword in perpetuity
I was a monk in a pacifist sect and our monastery was raided, me and a few others used some of the relics as weapons to fend off the attack, but we were expelled for breaking our vows of non-violence
I became a pit fighter to impress a pretty girl, but I became so succesful and popular I could have any girl I wanted and forgot about her, Eventually I realised she was more than just a pretty face and went crawling back to apologise, but she's a married woman now
I have many stories to tell, but I'm better at telling them when I'm drunk! Great tales of battle and cunning, sadness and joy, trials and victories, and some of them are even true!
Before I was born, my adopted father stole a powerful magic ring, Evil sorcerers came to take it back, so I fled my home and now I'm trying to figure out how to destroy it
In magic school, I foolishly released an evil shade into the world and I'm constantly fleeing to escape it
An evil wizard killed my parents, but was destroyed trying to kill me and now he's back, but no one believes me
My father brought me south while he served as an advisor to the king however the king died and my father was killed as a traitor
I stole a loaf of bread as my sister's child was near to death, Then I served nineteen years a slave to the law
The son of a local bandit chief killed my dog, I'm going to kill them all
I just am, I have always been, and chances are I will always be, So I decided to have some fun
I worked as a border guard between two warring nations, the things I saw I struggle to relive, I really do
My past? I was brought to life by a wizard, he didn't tell me anything, my age is unknown to me, am I a real person brought to life or some wizard conjuration, hmm, perhaps I've said too much
I know few tales myself, but there have been several who have had their tales ended at my blade
I joined with a mercenary group but we were sent to raid villages, I slipped out of the ranks and ran ahead to warn the village, joined the defence and became the hero of the village when they were able to defeat my ex-fellow mercenaries
Mostly just drinking, drinking and forgetting
I am ageless: a blessing and a curse, I have seen 100 kingdoms rise to power, only to fall by demon hands time and time again, I have witnessed my closest friends and family members perish in the demons' endless wars and pillaging, Enough Now it is my time to act, to change fate, to change history
I retired a decorated soldier, but have since lost everything my family's home included to drink and gambling, now I've nothing and nobody left, Maybe I'll earn back my place as a hero, maybe I'll die the wretched thing I am now, It's all the same to me
My father was once a mighty general, He taught me everything I know today and I now fight in his name
I was a blacksmith but after a while I grew tired of the back breaking work I had to do
I was a bank worker and I saw a lot of money over the years, eventually I decided it was time I got some riches for myself!
I was a soldier in a neighboring kingdom but we earned less gold than a begging goblin so I dropped off my uniform and went on my own path
I was born a noble but living the high life got old quickly to me, I wanted to get my hands dirty
I was a bandit, living off of stolen food and gold, but I knew fighting well enough to become someone who could do real good for our realm
Me? I'm just looking for trouble, have I found it?
I travelled around telling jokes, then one day an angry bandit drinking in a tavern I was in took a disliking to me and tried to kill me, ordinarily he would have won but he was drunk and it gave me the upper hand, after that I got scared and learned to defend myself, I ended up becoming a formiddable fighter
My past? why would you want to know about that?
I used to sell sweet rolls, then my store was robbed by a barbarian with an arrow lodged in his knee, had to set out as an adventurer after that
I was a scroll writer, I used to write stories but I ran out of inspiration, set out to adventure and gain experience with which to write from but I never returned to writing
I was an adventurer, once I found a strange village on the edge of a cliff, It was small but was once much bigger, a hag had cursed them to stay put, it was as though they weren't aware they were on a cliff as their relatives and fellow villagers and their houses plummetted over the years, I killed the hag and freed the remaining folk
As a young boy I dreamed of being the champion of the arena, I trained with other children and started my own tournaments, one day in a tournament I started in my village a boy died in a fight and I was blamed for organising it, I was condemned to work in a prison mine for the years growing into adulthood as a slave, I managed to escape one day and lived a life of freedom and adventure, never got to fulfil the goal of the arena championship though
Wouldn't you like to know
I forget my childhood, but my teenage years were spent as a caravan guard, mostly no problems but I've had a few scraps
I was a village guard, it was an uneventful existance so I left
I was a village guard, until my village was burned down, I fled and travelled around for a long time
My father used to beat me growing up, well one day I saw a recruiter coming through town and picking up all of the local thugs for forced service, I ran up and kicked him in the leg which guaranteed me a spot with the thugs away from my father, looking back it was the right choice
I lived with my grandparents for all my life, they died and left me their humble little farmstead but I wanted something different, I sold the land and set out to adventure
I used to be part of a small group of slave friends, we would go out and seek slavers and give them the brutal end they deserved
My father owned a tavern, I used to grow up around tough tavern brawlers and travellers, over time I yearned for the same life and became a tavern brawler, became rather good at it too
I was part of a small Warband, we came out of a village but travelled around protecting the lands from goblins and bandits, it was a good time but eventually we were ordered to be disbanded
I was part of a small militia group, one day the group was ambushed by some bandits, I was the only survivor, I don't like talking about it truth be told so I'm going to stop now
I was bashed in the head and have problems with memory so I don't really know how I ended up here if I'm honest, actually, where am I?
I was the guard of a foreign king for a while, a terrible king at that, I fought off an assassin but when I turned around the king was already dead, you see the fool choked on a chunk of meat he was eating while the fight happened, of course I was blamed and exiled
I was a village guard, I always wanted to do something involving force, swords, and glory, well village guard work turned out mostly to be chasing chickens so I moved on
I don't tell that tale, my past is mine and mine alone
I used to be an adventurer like you, and I still am
My past is one based outside of the law, I used to be a smuggler, nothing much to me other than that
I often make up stories, the truth is far less entertaining I'm afraid, I've just worked a lot
I used to live in the Blackmarket, I would head down to the sewers and trade with the folk there for a tidy profit as most would avoid them like the plague, although many did have the plague, *cough* *cough*
I used to live in the Blackmarket, I would do odd jobs here and there and then go and gamble my money away in the central district
I used to live in the Blackmarket and was training to be a professional pit fighter, I thought I might become the pit champion
I used to live in the Blackmarket, I was a pit fighter until one day a spike knuckled warrior boxed a hole in my head and I had to retire
I was the protector of a small hill for a lord who held a vast hilly territory, I remained on that hill for a great deal of time, defending it from passing travellers, collecting a toll, and ensuring all who passed the hill knew who owned it, my lord decided instead to build a castle on the hill and my service as hill guardian was no longer needed, and so I am here
I was a mushroom picker, used to traverse many woodlands searching for mushrooms, of course in this time I had my fair share of trouble, marauders, goblins, thugs and fools, but I survived, picking mushrooms, some were good for healing, some eating, some for, other things
I was the personal protector of a lord, my lord died in his sleep at an old age, a good retirement for a man like me, but alas, I need work
I came from a small village, never thought I'd amount to much but I've had a fairly adventurous life since then
I grew up in a small commune nested between large mountains, it was an isolated life but I set out and explored the realm
I used to work as a protector for a merchant caravan, but over time I saw the real money was in being a merchant, I'm looking for more lucrative work for now so that in the future I can set off on my own and open a trade business
I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee
I was a famed dice player, 12, sudden death, you name it, I was famous for it, I was banned in half the taverns in the land, the other half treated me like royalty, truth was I just used loaded die, they didn't need to know bless them
I am a member of a fairly prominent family of merchants, I decided for a life of adventure instead of trade however, I'd say it was the right choice
I was part of a group of three warriors, we travelled around questing but then the question was raised, who was the best warrior of our three, well now I am the only one alive, figure the rest out for yourself
I was an adventurer, I found myself in the Blackmarket in the north fighting in the slums for scraps of gold, not my proudest time
I was a city guard, but there was too much corruption, I had many brushes with death but came out alive
I trained up fighting with drunks in taverns, it was fairly easy practice but some of them put up a good fight, I'm strong now though
I used to work in a smithy until we got robbed one knight, my smithing hammer put an end to one of them and the rest ran, and I got to thinking perhaps a career change was due
I helped a small goblin broker peace between two warring goblin tribes, it was a difficult time and still many died, but we saved a lot of lives
I travelled to a foreign land in search of adventure and change and boy did I get it, travelling on the road with a tall elven woman for a few seasons certainly aged me, but I had adventure enough to last a lifetime, and the scars to prove it
Well it's a long story that involves a baby, two warring kingdoms and a short lad named willow
I was a used wolf-hide coat seller, it was a fairly lucrative but rather boring time
I have had a rather normal life until this point, I hope to have great adventures in the future
I was an adventurer, one time I saw a whole ship vanish on a quiet and somber sea
I always wanted to be a bard but I ended up getting stones pelted at me during practice by local troublemakers, after a while I had to fight them, I won and my life became fighting instead of playing music
I really don't talk about that anymore, but it's you so I'll tell you, long ago I was a bandit, not for any malicious reasons I was just lost, the stuff they made me do, I had to kill a child, after that I ran away and never looked back, I will never be at peace with it not until I die
I don't have a very interesting history I'm afraid, mostly boring farmwork and a few fistfights
I trained attack dogs for a foreign ruler, I miss those hounds, often met bad fates
I travelled with a troupe of musicians for a while but they got eaten by a troll, sad times indeed
I was an adventurer, once I found a very eerie door deep in some canyons in the far south, gave me the chills
I was an adventurer, once I found a group of nomadic warriors deep in the southern deserts, strongest warriors I've seen, their leader was a monster of a man
I was an adventurer, once I found a giant wall of sand and magic deep in the south, heard rumours of what lay behind it but alas, I could not pass it
I was an adventurer, once I found a group of strange folk shipwrecked along the western shore, I helped them repair their ship and they were friendly enough and shared some fish with me, but I had never seen anything like them, their bodies adorned in strange plants and glistening pearls
I became a mercenary following a troubled relationship, my heart was broken and I didn't care where the world took me, in this time I learned a new kind of pain, I fought in 3 wars, was a prisoner and later lead a prisoner revolt, I lead a small naval fleet and assisted my commanders in defeating our enemies once and for all, since then I have taken to less warlike pursuits, I like to bake
I used to sell odds and ends in the Blackmarket but eventually got bored of it and set off for a life of travel, I ran out of gold and now I'm here
I followed a band of red dragon flagged travellers for some time fighting beasts and saving maidens, eventually we split up
My origin isn't relevant, but I have travelled far and wide to work for you
I was a mine guard, used to make sure none of the miners stole any ore and that no outsiders tried to sneak in, boring job truth be told, the miners were good folk
I used to dive for sunken treasure, found some occasionally, one time found a gold goblet protected by an angry merman, I let him keep it
I was a worker at Monfort mine for a while, ended up leaving for something more, being in those caves every day was a painful existence
I was a butcher for quite some time, a local bandit came into my shop demanding a protection fee and I told him to leave and that if he ever came back I'd carve him faster than any other pig I'd had on my counter, unfortunately he didn't listen, he showed up with three men, none of them left, when the local guards showed up they claimed credit for it and that was that
I was a competition archer for a long time, did quite well too, but it's just not real, a bow is a weapon, weapons are used to kill, not to show off, ended up joining a group of hunters and then became a mercenary, then monster hunter, I kept killing things they just kept getting bigger, from targets to rabbits to men to trolls
I was hired due to my willpower and placed to guard a scroll in a tower, they said at any time people could come for it but no one ever did, the tower was tucked away below a cliff near a coastline, it took four hours to get down there from the cliff and 6 to get back up again, I was brought monthly deliveries of food and supplies and I guarded that tower for thirty years until finally the last essence of the scroll was disintegrated by the sea air
I was an adventurer, travelled with a group of young elves eager to earn some experience, we had a wonderful adventure, a shame one of the boys met his end falling into a chasm in a dark cave
I was an adventurer, I quested for an artifact, a golden toe, it had belonged to a king from many years ago who had lost a toe and replaced it with gold, we managed to find it, it was being used as a wizards paperweight, magic users eh!
I was an adventurer, I travelled far and wide in my time but never found a challenge I couldn't overcome
I was a messenger, I would ride day and night to send messages between lands, I loved the road
I was an acrobat for a while, but it's just not a profitable career so I took to mercenary work and used my acrobatic skills to my advantage
I was an adventurer, once my squire and I climbed up a huge spire and slew a crazed necromancer who was attempting to raise the undead
I was an adventurer, once I was captured and taken as a slave aboard a pirate vessel, I managed to break free and grabbed a cutlass challenging the captain to a duel, the fool agreed and that was his mistake, with the captain defeated I claimed the ship as mine, his first mate objected and I sliced his face in two, after that the crew weren't so vocal with their objections, I split the captains loot among them to raise spirits and we sailed the sea capturing the pirates they had once worked alongside
I was an adventurer, one time I found a mage who had cursed a wolf pack to follow him around and defend him, managed to kill him from a distance, apparently by killing him the wolves were now bound to me, he had been mistreating them but I'd never spent time with docile wolves before, they were great, I looked after them, and they me, we travelled north and I had many great years with them before they died out, unfortunately he had castrated them as part of his curse, gods I hate wizards
I was a sailor, saw a lot of waves in my life, a lot of storms, even pirates once or twice, an eventful life at sea
I was a member of a shipbuilding guild up in the blackmarket, used to work on all kinds of wooden ship parts, never got to sail on one though
I was a warlord before this, used to run a small band of men, we raided a few small settlements, simple things really
I used to be a city guard, I worked my way up to being second in command to the guard captain, went well for a while but I wanted something different
I used to fight in the brawl pits, earned a name for myself too, I used to only use my palms, slapped my way through the roster
I helped a short little goblin carry an enchanted bracelet to a mountain to dispose of it, we stopped a big evil from spreading into the land, you didn't hear about it?
I'm the son of a nobleman, nothing special but I will make my fortune, I know it
I was a painter for a while, used to paint landscapes, portraits of nobles and so on, I grew bored of a life of art in a world as magical as this though
I was a warlord, I used to command a small party of bandits and we would hold up the roads and take tributes from passing merchants and caravans, not my proudest time but we made good gold
I used to be a respected guardsman, one night the guard captains son got horribly drunk, the boy was a troublemaker, always tried to bark orders at us, well he burst into my watchtower waving a sword around, I disarmed him and that was that, no one got hurt, save for his pride, Not twenty minutes later he and a few of his friends in the guard are waiting for me outside, I didn't see them and was alone, I took a step outside and saw a blade swing for me, instinctively I dodged it and killed the man, the captains son burst out from behind a tree with two more companions, I slew them all, by the following morning the guard captain screamed the city down looking for me calling for my head, so I escaped with the help of some friends and here I am
I was a village champion far from here, always a strong lad, ended up beating the champion of the village in a fist fight, it was great until I had to fight so often that I was only ever doing one of three things, aching, sleeping or fighting, I left the village in search of something better
I was a petty thug, as was tradition with my family, my father and brothers were the same, I joined up with a group of troublemakers and before I knew it we were robbing people on the road, one day we catch a nobles carriage, there were three of us and only one guard, one of my companions killed the guard by surprise and we halted the carriage, a moderate sum of gold inside, the passenger was a young noblewoman and her young child, my companions dragged her out, ripped off her jewellery and asked her to beg for her life, I told them to stop and our ringleader looked at me angrily and then swung his sword for her head, I parried him and he snarlled at me, calling me a traitor, in the ensuing fight I killed the ringleader, my other companion ran away, I put the noblewoman and child on one of the horses, gave her their valuables and told her to ride fast to her destination, and with that my life of banditry was over, I travelled for some time, purposeless, but alas, here I am
I used to fight in the brawl pits, I won a good few fights and became moderately known but it just wasn't for me, I wanted something better
I was a mercenary for some time with a large outfit, oh did we have many a glorious battle, in the end the group disbanded over pay but I continued to work smaller contracts as a solo mercenary
I was a famed hunter, I was always good at hunting thanks to my father, One day I heard a rumour, the golden stag, a mythical creature had been spotted in a forest a great many miles beyond me, I quested for it, and didn't find it, but I found a strange yellow slop in the swamps and painted a dead deer carcass yellow, the dumb villagers believed me and I was proclaimed the greatest hunter
I was a militia master, me and my childhood friends defended our lands from all manner of trouble over the years, but truth be told, I had about as many encounters in my time as a militia master as I could count on my hands, I've decided to strike out and try doing something different before I get too old
I was famed for fighting off a band of tribal goblins that attacked a village, I have nothing against goblins though, but the raiding ones are a nuisance
I was once a diplomat that made peace between goblins and men, more than once I had to fight to prove myself though, sometimes the goblins can be brutal when they are in their packs
I was the head of a small militia that saved a region from a reaving goblin warband, we set many traps for them, fought many skirmishes, we fought mostly alone with no intervention by anyone else, a bunch of farmers against a band of goblin berserkers, we managed to do it though, we didn't scare them off, we caught them off guard on their way to raid us and we gave them hell, I lost good friends, but we alone put down the goblin horde, since then many from our militia have set out to the world, some to be mercenaries, but since then bandits have steered clear of our region
I was a caravan leader who made a good amount of money heading caravans between the kingdoms and the goblins, the trade with the goblins was overlooked by many others but it set me up
I worked with some goblin slavers, I used to round them up, usually we'd just attack low level goblin settlements and take as many as we could, if not all of them
I was a mercenary in the wild north for some time, the place was too savage for me, I couldn't stand working with those bastards, they were barely civil, children of savages, a lot of them came from wildermen settlements, they acted barbaric and I killed more than a few of them, even though we were supposedly on the same side, I hate wildermen, I made too many rivals there so I had to come here
I was a mercenary in the wild north but the place was too honourless for me, I almost lost my morals with them
I was a mercenary in the wild north, but I know I'm due for bigger things
I worked at the combat academy for a while, I would help train the fighters, they would come in all shapes and sizes but they would leave as hardened warriors
I spent some time with the love cult, I found peace but the world has not, I seek to learn the ways of the world and bring a peace to it
I was a councillor for the love cult but death has struck close to me, I need some time in the real world, the harshness of reality may make my bitter feelings feel less lonely in my mind
I was, well am, a bard, I played my lute for a long time, made a bit of a name for myself around some taverns, but I'm handy with a sword too, I swear
Well you may know me as a fairly famed lute player, I have grown tired of it though
Me, I was, I was come from wilderman land, me, I am good warrior of wildermen, but I not savage, not smart with word, but not savage, I am loyal
I was a guard for a fairly wealthy farm for a while, what an uneventful job that was
I was an artifact market trader for a while, I made good money too
I am the son of a wilderman chief, but I spent more of my childhood in the blackmarket, our mother snuck south to the blackmarket and we worked in a tavern for a while, I grew up in the fighter's district training and ended up being a fairly well-known pit fighter before turning to mercenary work and now this
I was a blackmarket tavern conman for a while, and like any good northman got into my fair share of brawls, I learned a lot in my time there
I was a farmer but I ended up gaining some local fame after a mean old raider came into our village claiming he was king now, he had a little group with him too, well I was having a bad day so I came out and poked him with my pitchfork, took one of his eyes out with the hit, he was dead in seconds and his companions fled, I was hailed a champion
I was once a demon worshipper long ago but I was able to break away from the dark thought patterns that led me there and escaped the camp I was at, the demonic forces are not to be ignored, this I have learned in my time, they must be stopped
I was a merchant for a time, made good money too but that life got too far ahead of me, the simplicity of adventure was far more alluring
I was the guard of the elder of my village for a time, they said I was the toughest in the village, the locals, bless them, wouldn't dare speak ill of the elder out of fear of the consequences, of course I didn't actually hurt any of them, they were afterall my friends and fellow villagers
I was a guard tasked to capture some escaped prisoners who had killed a great many in their escape attempt, I managed to find them holed up with some bandits in the blackmarket and after a harsh battle myself and my companions were victorious, only one of the escaped prisoners was captured alive though
I was a bounty hunter for a while, caught myself a fair few criminals, petty bandits, it was a good career
I was a northern explorer, my companions and I would delve into northern ruins and find either loot or a fight, never found any quiet ruins
I was nomadic in the south for a while, everywhere prior to the drylands, I roamed, couldn't go any further because Koova's lot were too territorial but I saw my fair share, the south is a pretty lifeless region
I was known as the wolfslayer where I came from, I was a hunter, but hunted mainly rabbit, nothing aggressive, one day I had mistakenly chanced upon a wolves den, these wolves had killed a village boy not a week earlier, they charged at me but I managed to climb a tree and shot them dead with my bow, as I climbed down a lone wolf I had not spotted lunged at me, a blood fight ensued but alas, the wolf was history, and with that, the den was cleared and the ravenous wolves were no more
I was an explorer for a while, traversing mainly the wild north, the area is filled with fascinating things, uncontacted savage tribes including a group who worship a god they think lies atop the mountain who's feet they sleep at, many mysteries in the north
I was an explorer, I mainly delved into the far north though the place can be too harsh, met a tribe of snowfolk up there, not savage like the wildermen, but different to any group I've met
I was once a captain, I had several soldiers beneath me and would lead patrols around the realm, nothing big often happened, had a few run ins with bandits and goblins but we always had them outnumbered
I was a coastal watchman, had to make sure pirates didn't raid the coast, and show them it wasn't worth it if I saw them coming, only had one ship dumb enough to try their luck with us but luckily we had the high ground and a lot of advantages, you almost felt sorry for them
I was part of an adventurer group that hunted for artifacts to sell in the Artifact market in the east, it was a harsh time, but a rewarding one, we only found one artifact in our entire time as adventurers, I remember it now, we found a huge underground goblin city, I couldn't believe my eyes, it looked more advanced than any human ruin I'd seen, the city was laid out in an interesting pattern and the materials from which it was build were unfamiliar, the place was empty, just dust and the odd cave spider, but when we got to the centre, there it was, a large elevated throne and on it, a goblin corpse, small, meek, it looked like that of a child, and in it's clutches, the staff, surrounding the throne were hundreds of other skeletons, kneeling to the throne, We took the staff and the city began to collapse in on itself, we managed to escape but I lost one of my companions on the way out, after selling the artifact we were all relatively wealthy and most of us decided to quit there and then
I was a mine foreman for quite some time, kept those welps in shape, a lot can go wrong in a mine you know, and the foreman always gets the earfull over it
I came from Arasuk, a place in the south, I was not meant for a place full of folk like that, no free thinking, I took to the roads with a passing knight who for some ungodly reason found himself in the south, we adventured around the land after that, I was his squire but I had to swing a sword many a time, once we found ourselves in the north defending a small village from wildermen, another time we encountered a band of gold armoured warriors protecting a strange cave, wild adventures indeed
I spent my youth in a village, boy I thought I was in for a boring life, our village got raided when I was around 13 years old, I tried to fight but I was enslaved instead, spent some years as a slave working in a mine, but with the help of others we revolted, as a free man I took to hunting slavers for a while, taking their ill-gotten gains and freeing their servants, gained a name for myself even
I was born in a small village but I managed to get out and joined an army, I had a fairly distinguished career there too
I was a first mate aboard a trade vessel, think caravanning on the sea, that was us, we ran some safe routes but toward the end of my career those routes got far harsher, we came up against some well armed pirates and barely made it out with our lives
I cannot tell of my past, forgive me, but it is too painful to relive
I do not have too interesting a story to tell I'm afraid
I was a master cartographer for the guild of cartographer's in the north, I would explore the unknown and find out as much as I could, risky job, definitely landed me in hot water more than once
I worked at the slavers fort for a while, I was in charge of a group of slavers but it just wasn't for me, cruel men indeed
I was a scout for the army, I used to go and spy on other kingdoms, sometimes alone and sometimes with a group, we would explore into new areas we'd yet to map out too
I was a guard, guarded a small trade post, the job wasn't exciting, surprisingly no one tried to attack us, all the regional powers were trading through the trade post so I suppose they didn't see it as being in their interests
Me, I did all kinds of odd jobs, anything to make myself some gold, worked too, I had a tavern once, used to sell artifacts and weapons, even used to be a brawler, usual stuff I suppose
I was a fight pit promoter for a while, used to get the boys hyped up about fights, get people into the pits, its not hard, when you're in the north especially when for those not fond of the blackmarket it's the only other thing to do, definitely had my fair share of trouble working there though, violence is a constant part of life
If I told you my past, I would have to kill you, hahahahaha
I was a slaver in the north for a while, I worked independently but sold my slaves to the slavers fort, I was good too, made a decent living, but it's a job that asks much of your morals and in the end I needed a break
I was a mercenary, not the best mind you but lucky when it counted, worked out for me enough times
I was a knight of the order of the roses, but decided I was overdue for a change of scenery, the order still gives me great pride though
I fear I cannot reveal my past, I am under an oath never to tell of what happened to anyone, even a ruler
I worked in the Blackmarket docks for a while, doing odd jobs, the place really started going downhill and work dried up, did a bit of mercenary work here and there too
I was briefly the champion of the Brawl pit, but I held the title only for a single fight and was beaten the very next fight, a shame, but perhaps a blessing, I've seen what happens to some champions in those pits, sometimes they never make it out alive, I've seen even the most invincible looking champions get killed, it's a dangerous place
