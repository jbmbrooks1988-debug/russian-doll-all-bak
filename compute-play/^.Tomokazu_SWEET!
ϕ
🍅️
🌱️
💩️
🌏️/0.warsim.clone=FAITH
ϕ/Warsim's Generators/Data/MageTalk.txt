Speak to the guild master if you have any questions, I am far too busy
Unless you know how to concoct a batblade serum I don't want anything to do with you
You're not a member, what are you doing here
[He stares at you blankly]
Eye of newt... tail of newt... body of newt... that should do it
I'm working on... well you wouldn't understand
The Mage guild is not a place for those who do not understand magic
Strange... something strange about you
The Blackmarket is a place not to be underestimated either, great magic is hidden there
This market is stronger than most kingdoms
Oh dear, my potions are bubbling, that's not good
Oh no, I used the wrong concoction
This world is full of mystery and wonder, I seek to find as much of it as I can, the beating heart of the world, the magic gold bag, so many hidden things to find
I feel an uneasy presence
Who are you?
Yes... there is something about you...
You're a strange one aren't you
Abracadabra!
Expelliamus!
Rubadubdub!
Dorkus Malorcus!
Alakazam!
Eye of newt, tail of newt, body of newt... there we go!
What do we have here?
Magic my friend, magic is the way
We have several guilds around the land
Many secrets, but we cannot say
Do not ask questions that you do not wish to know the answer to
There is lots of dark magic in the world
This realm does not feel stable, too much evil
Years of working on magic has made me lose touch with the ladies, fear not though I have come up with a pick up line that I can guarantee will find me a wife... I've got 100% resistance to fire but you're still making me hot!
I can feel it in the air, the chaos
If you are not careful, you will end up like them [He points to a skeleton in the corner]
The Mage guild is a place of knowledge and mystery
The Mage Guild is not to be underestimated
I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk, I'm very busy
Simsalabim!
I have seen many things in my years, but never have I seen someone like you
