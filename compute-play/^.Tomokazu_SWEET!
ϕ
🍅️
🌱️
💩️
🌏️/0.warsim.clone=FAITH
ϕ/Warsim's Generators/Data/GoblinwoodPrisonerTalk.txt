I pee on statue, but it was dark. I didn't see it was statue.
I hate being in dungeons, it bad for your health.
[The goblin stares at you without blinking]
[The goblin looks at you angrily]
What you want human? Goblin is not painting, do not LOOK AT!
[The goblin appears to be sulking and ignores you]
I cannot be here, I have a skin flake pie cooking on a rock in the sun. Someone will take it.
Please human, help me.
[The goblin seems sad and ignores you]
Goblin said that Goblinwood not so great, now I am in dungeon.
I was free like you once, now I am a prisoner with all these halfwit goblins... oh the shame.
WHAT YOU LOOK AT HUMAN?!
[The goblin points at you and snarls]
Human come to laugh at goblin shame?
What you want?
I want freedom back now.
Goblin was free, being not free is bad.
Help human, please.
I will be free in twenty years, but goblin live only for ten more.
At least it warm here.
I stole a sweetroll. Please help, they kill me soon.
I insult king, big mistake.
I try to sneak into the jamboree. They never let me out now, this big crime.
I was caught stealing a loaf of bread. Please help, I am so hungry.
I was born in dungeon. Please help, I want to see the world.
Me am here for daring to dream. Please help, Me want free free.
[The goblin looks at you with a hopeful expression]
Human, please help me escape from this dungeon. I don't want to die here.
