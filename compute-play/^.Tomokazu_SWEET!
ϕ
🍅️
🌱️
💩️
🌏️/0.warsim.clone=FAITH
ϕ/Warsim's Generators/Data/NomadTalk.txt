Many moons ago the nomads had a rule where any man who wished to challenge our leader could do so, it had to stop after so many deaths, no one even dares to challenge him
Koova is blessed beyond our understanding
If ever a man could lead us it is Koova
with Koova at our side we aren't scared to scrap with the demons
Ever seen a demon, they are worse than you can imagine
Nothing more pleasing than a dead demon, you fight your wars for land and wealth, we are here saving the world
I once saw Koova rip a mans tongue from his mouth in a fight
I once saw Koova break a mans nose with a slap
I once saw Koova crush a mans skull with a punch
I once saw Koova kill three armed men with just a shield
I once saw Koova pull a mans eyeballs from his face and throw them off the edge of the canyon
I once saw Koova snap a snake in two
I once saw Koova wrestle a desert tiger to death, taking control of the pack
I once saw Koova dive into a row of soldiers knocking them off a cliff
I once saw Koova burst a mans eyeballs by punching him so hard in the face
Koova is the leader of his own pack of tigers
Koova is the most barbaric man to ever walk the lands I would say
Koova could kill anything living or dead
Koova is an unstoppable monster
You're a king, bring an army to the Drylands and see if you can take it
Little armies sometimes make their way here, they look for demons but they find us, they wish they'd found demons
We may be small in number, but we are no underdog, we are the mightiest force in the land
That blood river angers me, why is it there
The blood river is a strange place, they say its a mirage
Ever seen Koova fight, it's an honour to fight him but he never fights seriously with his own men, lest they be killed
The skull of the last titan lies near the entrance to the Drylands, a terrible thing must have killed him and it wasn't Koova, it was long before he was born
You will know when you are in the Drylands, as at it's entrance is the corpse of one of the strongest creatures to ever walk the lands, if that doesn't indicate danger you are a fool
There is a strange dead beast in a cave not far from here, it smells
They say them rotten wood things in the lake bed used to float, I'd love to have seen that
That coastwall, it's got a strange glow to it
The coastwall holds treasure behind it I reckon, why else would it be so hard to get in
Tried to climb the coastwall but couldn't do it, something strange about it
I'd love to know what's behind that sandy wall, we'll never know
Koova even tried to punch the coastwall once, didn't even dent the thing, we were all shocked, it must be godly
Never been down the canyon but koova says there's a door down there
The Canyons got a damned big drop
That Canyon ain't easy to traverse
There are none living that could hold their own against Koova, trust me
Us nomads are hardy folk
Couldn't imagine living still, sit around too long and get complacent
Koova! Koova! Koova! Koova!
Death to all demons
Canyon jumping is really fun, sometimes I go there to practice
The Dry river is a strange place, I wonder what happened to the landscape
The Eerie cave, some witch lives there
There's something not right with that cave, a horrid hag lives there, even Koova wont go there
A man once claimed that the witch of the cave was guarding something
That odd rock formation, I reckon it was a sword from a giant trying to burst out from underground
That strange rock, I reckon it was built by some people before us, maybe it was a watchtower
The Demon gate is a place of horror, we share the drylands with those beasts
The Demons of the demon gate, not for the light hearted
The Demon gate is a passageway to another world, a dark and twisted one at that
That demon gate cannot be stopped
Those demons are monsters, but we are monster hunters
Those demons are easily the toughest foe we've had
The demons have been coming out of the gate since before we were born but we'll stop them
I fear the demons if I'm honest, I've seen what they can do
Demons to the south of us, nothing can stop them
I'm a Spearman, we have quite a lot of spear use here, they are good to throw too unlike swords
I mostly fight in the pits here but we sometimes have to fight others, there's no bad blood between nomads though, Koova would not allow it
I am a rock-wearer, as you can imagine we don't have a wealth of armour here, I craft complex armour sets out of slate rock and snakeskin, it works well enough
I am known as a canyon jumper, we don't actually jump across the canyon but have learned how to traverse it, there's a weird door down at the bottom of the canyon you know
Koova says he'll slay every last demon, and for all his achievements and his conviction, having seen them, I don't believe him
My mind is lost, Koova is a god among men, he has done so much in his life, on the other hand, the demons are literally monsters from another realm, I hope Koova is better
