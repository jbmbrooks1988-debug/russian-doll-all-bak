Took a whole family in chains once, children too, was a nice payout for me
You lose empathy after a while, the people were dumb enough to get caught, and besides if you're the one slaving you're automatically above them
I love nothing more than punishing the slaves for my own unresolved feelings
I was once a slave, but I saw no problem with the system, sure I suffered, but I have risen through hard work and brutality, and now I am the one with the whip
I do not enjoy slaving, but good pay is hard to come by and beggars cant be choosers
I captured a famous old warrior once, the look on his face when he was in chains, I'll admit I was a little afraid of him even then, luckily they put him to fight in the slave pits and he didn't last too long
I love it when they run, few can run faster than a slaver
I lost a finger fighting with someone I was trying to capture once, the blighter got away too... I'll never forgive them
Sometimes you get so frustrated trying to catch a potential slave you just kill them
I remember once capturing a boat full of refugees from a recently destroyed kingdom, best payout I ever had
We helped some bandits raid a village once, they took most of the loot and we took the villagers
Nothing sweeter than catching an ex-slaver and putting him in shackles
Got to kick the slaves to let them know who's in charge
The slaves aren't even human in my opinion, once you are a slave you are lesser
I try to treat the slaves nice, but you've got to be careful, if you get caught you could end up in chains with them
I remember one slave, quiet from the day they brought him in, it irked me, so I split his foot open, he was so loud the entire fort heard him, of course he was no good to us with a split foot so we put him down
Nothing makes me feel better than knowing I am above the slaves
I think slavery is needed, fact is some men are lesser than others
Heard two slaves talking about a plan, had the buggers killed, can't take any chances
I feel paranoid, like the slaves will revolt...
We've had attempted revolts in the past, last time a lot of people died
Never get caught by a slaver, the life these slaves live is harsh and short
Slaves are needed for the world to grow as great as it needs to
Some men are born to be slaves, others born to be slavers
One day I will retire and take with me a band of slave soldiers questing
Do you need any slaves?
You should buy some slaves if you haven't already
You want any slaves?
Who am I to comment on the morality of the system in which I thrive
Slaves are nothing
Don't feel bad for them, they aren't like us, we are better
I reckon our fort could survive a hell of a seige
Our fort is one of the marvels of the north they say
Do you like the fort, would you guess it was built by the blood and sweat of thousands of slaves
I marvel at the fort sometimes, we could be a force to reckon with if we wanted to
Our master is a dark fellow, I dare not stand in his way
The master scares me, I'd keep out of his way if I were you
The slave master is a mysterious figure, he rarely speaks to us, but when he does, it is as though his voice commands thunder
Psst... the slave masters name is Balan, but keep it quiet
I don't like how the master thinks he's above us, maybe this is how it feels to be a slave
Saw someone speak out against our master once, had his throat slit in seconds
Sold a few slaves to a cannibal clan the other day, I did feel momentarily guilty, you should have seen the slaves faces when they figured it out
Everyone condemns slavery when it suits them but the number of kingdoms and companies who've used slave labour... well it's almost everyone
Sold some slaves to a goblin chief the other day, we don't question it as long as they pay, I think the chief is planning to make it look like he captured them in battle to win favour with other chieftains
Sold a lot of slaves to the east like no other
Had a mysterious client come for some slaves recently, cloaked fellow, never did see his eyes but he had skin as pale as the moon's glow
Any slave that runs from a fight gets killed, makes them fight pretty wildly when they need to
I think some of the slaves enjoy fighting, gives them a bit of control, a chance to win and be on top
Some of our slaves are meaner than pit fighters
I reckon we should open up our own pit, we'd have a good roster of forced fighters, cheap too
I sometimes wish I could have my own slave soldier army, go and capture myself some land
Our fort is well defended, we've got a good mix of fighters and slaves
The slaves are the backbone of our fort, they do all the hard work so we can enjoy ourselves
I think the slaves know they are better off here than out there, they work hard and don't complain
The slaves here have it good compared to most, they should be thankful
I was once a refugee myself, I know what it's like to be desperate, but I would never stoop so low as to be a slave
There are worse things than being a slave
Being a slave is not so bad, you have food and shelter and a purpose, what more could you want?
Being a slave is better than being dead
Some of the slaves here have it worse than others, but they all knew the risks when they were captured
No one ever tries to escape from here, not anymore
