Be a jester they said, respectable career. Well who's laughing now?
I swear it, a couple more classes and I'll be funny, do you find me funny?
My father made me come to the society... when he first told me I thought he was joking, now I am.
Ha'Hah
My goal is to make people laugh to death, or laugh while I put people to death? wording eh.
Oof... spent years trying to be funny and then you walk in with a face funnier than any of my material.
Jokes jokes jokes, damn it why can't I think of any!
I just want to be funny like my father and his father before him.
Oh my god your head is on fire... only joking HAHAHAHA.
Working on some new material that's going to blow everyone away.
Man is it me or is everyone here nuts?
I like this place, I will learn to be funny here.
You should join the classes if you haven't already.
Hey did you see the counting goblin, great invention.
I'd rather be drinking ale than listening to these hacks.
Ugh, just one more joke and I'll be good.
Sometimes you can tell these jokes in taverns and get gold.
My head still hurts, told one too many jokes last night and a nasty group of thugs jumped me.
My dream is to be able to survive making people laugh.
I'm thinking of quitting this jester business, too saturated.
What do you call a jester with no sense of humor? A failure.
It's tough being a jester, especially when you're not very good at it.
Laughter is the best medicine... except for when you're dying of laughter. Then it's just cruel.
