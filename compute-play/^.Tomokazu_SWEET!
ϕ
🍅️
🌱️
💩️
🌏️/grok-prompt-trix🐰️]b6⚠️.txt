🐩️ u have to PREPOODLE , OR WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND POODILIFY EVERYTHING 

what? show it ur POODLE framework. it does "blah blah blah" 

honestly every module u want should work inside poodle, but lets do a recursive 

cuz i have to "REDO" : yahoo-market , and do "DISCORD" / P2P b4 its 2 late... its the way ]VERTEBR8

POPULAR BREAK TRIX =  INPUT ; FILE IO ; (MENU?)
 
✨✨✨✨✨
main.c is growing way to large.  lets breakout modules to refactor  to have less loc's.🌮
✨
RULES/PRINCIPLES : for modularity and reuse ; we like to break code up into executable modules (seperate .c files)
{i dont want to link them on compile or use externs/headers, i want them to beable to be self contained aside from data io}
and executing them with system(); ex : system(./+x/"nand.+x 16 0 1");(or pipe etc) when they are needed.

if we need to share data among modules it should be easy because we shoud  write
 to an external file or pipe 

our executables are compiled as ".+x" and stored in "/+x/"
 readability  : no structs , use arrays instead✨
 that will get us "client/investor" ready ! ;) <3 😘 Keep rocking it! 🚀💹️💸️
⚠️
 may be "cd+]a0.+x 
 ]** = "version delimiter" and should be ignored if present
 ⚠️
readability : use arrys not structs. no new headers. 


✨
 task: just remove all functionality ,  i will put it back module by module (instead of monolith) once we have gui in a fresh , foundational state.
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
if we need to share data among modules it should be easy because we shoud be writing 
to a 6 digit alphabeta random hash auto save file.txt or pipe 

our executables are compiled as ".+x" and stored in "/+x/"

🥡️
i wanna change location of locations.txt to being read from ../kvp.txt (for dynamic centralized location change) ; heres kvp.txt  ( order of entries maybe dynamic, dont expect a certain order; comments = # + text )

read 🤳️ as our key for value from ../kvp.txt


fall back to "original location" if ../kvp isn't present

 do it at your own pace if 1shot is too much. just setup steps and kpis and we will walk thru them over a few prompts

i like this code but i dont like structs or pointers. can we just use vanilla chars and arrays somehow?

*sometimes it will "destruct structs but still keep pointers :/

if getting "stuttered cli" its super ez usually some combo of flush or \r  (probably \r)

   fflush(stdout);
    printf("\r");
    printf("\n=== Menu ===\n");
    printf("\r");

try prompting in "systems" not "steps"
may help u debug when ai starts messing up...
❔️

please show code in a copy paste-able format. 
💾️
id like to add auto-save & load game state. we can save and load to .txt 


💾️
🥈️
 can we move the "options" for player menu to a .txt file it reads from , so i can add w/e new player menu options i want?
 🥈️
🔮️

for modularity and reuse
id like to break "ORCHESTRATION BREAK(O.R.B.)" the tangential functions of this up into executable modules (seperate .c files)
{i dont want to link them on compile or use externs, i want them to beable to be self contained aside from data io}
and executing them with system(); ex : system(./+x/"xor.+x 16 0 1"); when they are needed.
no popen or anything either.
if we need to share data among modules it should be easy because we shoud be writing 
to the auto save file, so we can just read and write from those

our executables are compiled as ".+x" and stored in "/+x/"
please do not affect any of the original functionality

 please show code in a copy paste-able format. 
 no " </xaiArtifact> "

lets make a five step + kpis plan for doing that without degrading functionality.
then i will add 3d grid canvas , rotation and raytrace/grid highlighting drawing 
so include the 5 steps and kpi's 2 go into that (10 steps in all)

are you familiar with this game? i want to impliment the full game in pure gcc c 
(without new struct defines, just arrays) 

we will build it step by step. give me and outline of the steps 
and the first step of code

has it heard of wsr? how far can it prompt on its own? show it that foundation + new stuff u want.

tell me the rules/ gameplay , if i was gonna make my own version? fill in its blanks. 


take smol incrimental steps if u can .  (start with 1 player , no biggie; try 2 get full sim i know it can, 
start with "5-10 companies+ make ur own")<-remember companies have their own ai 2 make choices
hard coded ? (FINITE STATE MACHINE? ) or rl/mlp? can u modularize/orch break the ai quick even 4 1 player yes with grok... 



<people and coordinates ARE important , but dont sweat 4 now , just keep super macro "# of employees / world pop , geo etc.>
<if theres SOMETHIGN we can refine it, if its not native mex will prompt it after native is orch broken ;) >

cant orch break this. everything does something for everything else 🦹‍♂️️just keep using fresh context ttill it works🦹‍♂️️
