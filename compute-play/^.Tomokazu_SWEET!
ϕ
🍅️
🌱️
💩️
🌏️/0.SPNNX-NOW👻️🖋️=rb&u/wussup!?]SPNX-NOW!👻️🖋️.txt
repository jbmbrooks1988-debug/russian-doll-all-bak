all this qwen this warsim that. 

why am i not just doing 

"SOL PEN" 

u mean the levels from rmmv? 

its actually not a bad idea. 
(this other stuff can surround it like rmmv



the tactics stuff, 
the npc's able 2 be added 2 teams, the bossfites
the traveling etc. 
(controling levling / progression items
as an open world game from 1d , maybe arch lucr ltr🤔️

at least theres "SOMETHING THERE"


🇺🇸️
ok since were doing this 
its basically a clone as a human pokemon trainer
who gets 2  choose clone/or clown the etnire time. B&W

(tangent 2 sp story line which is super safe. 
but doing stuff for sol <- gov contractor. WARDOGS🔍️


wow thats alot of work. cool . 
is there any hax? 
doing our own ai? 

bespoke local procgen that goes 2 and fro
bigger ais like "water ways?"

this is why i try 2 keep dev tight and push wsr. 
but r&d science doesn't hurt..

🎚️
is this redundant. not from a mba/r&d pov]
 the point is "yes sliders" but also
"slider limits and guidepost 4 particular games

different scope perspectives 2 drop into than just
wsr. 4 holistic solutiNOS
as epseriment 2 see our abilities with this arch
and wut else we may add b4 its 2 late (like sliding menus 2 locking menus 
sure we slide them THEN lock them  stuff liiek that🎚️

im building tech ai specifically 
and maybe we can bootstrap power ai faster. 
and otherwise w/e 
other ppl i dont see doing this so "THAT(the worlds way)" isn't the way

its fine as a trillion dollar corp but their mostly 
getting clowned. momentum wise / capitalization /speed scope etc. 🤡️

if we enable our own ai ecosystem that just
bilds "SPIRL/ UNOMAN w/e idgaf"

🗺️would be nice 2 load rmmv maps. 
but u may get further here just proc genning and pushing. 
who cares about 'loading rmmv json maps ,its not loike u did substantial fx in there , and still w/ emvp ;]IOS🗺️


this should be bots first + designed levels (is also chimochio . just make bots first then pimp it out ; GETIT? )
👨🏽‍🚀️
(u kinda have it opengl2d , so u just have ask 4 an ascii version )

🧰️
will go thru dirs and delete the jpgs. pull them from image corpus pointer or render them as pixels , fool. ]ASCII
🧰️
😆️
♟️u know how chess does it 4 accesability? = b4 to d19 ] u can do that 2 . 

but also want 2 add a selector 🗡️
♟️

👨🏽‍🚀️

i want the same kind of 

warsim/wsr flow

but as a "tomokazu" 💩️= SLOP (user never knows or does w/e)
wuts a tomokazu . basically a "chimochio/digimon/tomogatchi"
(its chocolate candy thing w/e]KISS)
KONICHIWA I SELL SERVERS 
----------------------------- 


and were just gonna try same "INFRA"
but super simple

shit, eat, blah blah . and see if ai cant add stuff

maybe "NOT AS PEICES"
but then go back over and do them as peices
(the way wsr looks was eaiser imo 
using infra 2 peices, than peices 2 infra; get it? \


maybe easiest 2 go back into 2d / 3d? 
who knows we will see

wussup? can use these first 2 do the 
"text based menu refactor" 
but also 2 try other stuff. 
purposely keeping it "NOT WSR LIKE" 2 sell / play ez. 


also 
i want a "SUPER MENU " = TSOTS/TOMOKAZU . that lets both these open.

TSOTS = cloud interface + blockchain / social etc
TOMOKAZU = games interface
