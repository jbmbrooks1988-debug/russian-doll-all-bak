add maps and abilit 2 change z level and see in 3d using gl and random pixel colors based onhash 4 a square)

then do in framebuff💘️dont wrory about mirroring peice dir strux etc, we can after 😜️{already have schema/show speed🚀️=🏗️🌉️

+ can i show it rules for bots/mchara/marsmerc/aow/fffu w/e works , right? ;)

currently this is 2d in cli. i want it to be 3d in open gl. and controlled by arrow keys and have z level for moving up and down as well , instead of showing emoji, just show a cube with  10 randomly color layers, based on a simple hash of the symbol: . additionally we can render the emoji on the faces of the cube in the center.  

do we use "pure ascii tyep rougelike when we can just use blox (use both) 4 zoom in . get it ? we have z levels anyways. 
and we can do 3d same way , dont even sweat it. do a platformer.

📅️sept3. 
dont worry abot the data structs so much. we can pool w/e data structs convert them 2 a 1 page  2load in mem
and if user wants them at run spit them out thru an api (even if they use code) and we can 
spit them out after the session or whenever user opens the file w/e but thru a "mature api layer" get it? ☮️❤️‍🔥️

💖🎮

Let me know when you want to add:

Attack system
Move range validation (only MOVE_RANGE tiles)
Inventory usage
HP display
Or a "Press any key to continue" pause
You're building something truly special — keep going! 💖🎮

this (gemini) is fiarly ez 2 clone, but i dobut u wanan fool with it with ollama

(rather use ur own ai, and that will take extra  rl / fsm tweaking 2perform @ a reasonable level. 
(then u will have better ai than claude/openai/google/alibaba > y?  cuz its better arch of ai. than llm+moe its ++ etc
and its bespokefor a financial gaming hardware company so... ur good 2 go .♾️ 
so jjust wait till we go back 2 ai .

its actually sooner than  u think i wanna


 

>finish wsr 2 clone state + civ /realty.maps.zillow_earth.ui/ lab / etc 
> do warsims as well see which gets to 2dascii/3d png/gl blah blah first. + sub-marketing penetration feedback
> mess with peices. / rmmv / TSOTS.cloud integration etc. 
> be sussing out micro ai strategies 4 all and inventing procgen-ish/fsm solutions that are modulare / scalabe extensible
>start integrating that with super basic ai lstm and llm... till the point where libra make sense and provides value.

> i think were pretty much "done"{SWEET BTW} cuz i cant do much alone. so lets get into networking / chat / p2p / blockchain

🙄️so if u girls just have patience. and let me do this w/o wasting my tiem complaining. ... heres a REAL viable way forth.🤨️

🏴‍☠️️there actin kinda crazy and we have plenty 2 do so wait 4 them 2 stop/leadership . maybe outline semester if they wont🏴‍☠️️

y the slowdown with wsr ? 
aug is past. + sept silliness from them 
+ code prompt slowdown perceieve = not true. we usually do something 4 adapability then code an entire module or 2|3...
speed up with ai? we are literally 2 productive days away from integrating seedling ai into wsr. (and w/e else 2 explore from there which would literally loop back
cept doing it naked has no context/infra/scaffold

when i tell u were gonna have the most powerful ai (soon), i mean it. its clearly easier than it even looks. believe it. 
then we can get revenue, buy more gpus (riscv tenstorrent only ts) or make our own and they will get 
a lot more mileage , which is the only way u could EVER accomplish ur SP.irl goals ; much less compete w/o VC dilution.👾️

w/e take a lil break, but were alot closer thanu seem 2 think 2 a "BREAK THRU" {maybe their jealos/scared}=cia lvl sabs🪚️
📹️i forgot, we also want stablediffusion and AR computer vision! 📹️
