Gemini CLI and Qwen CLI appear to work similarly because Qwen CLI is a fork of Gemini CLI, adapted specifically for Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen3-Coder models. Both are open-source, terminal-based AI coding assistants built in TypeScript and installable via npm, designed to integrate large language models into developer workflows. Their shared functionality stems from Qwen CLI’s origins as a derivative of Gemini CLI, with modifications to optimize for Qwen’s models, such as enhanced parsers and customized prompts.[](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)[](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/qwen-code)

### Why They Work Similarly
- **Shared Codebase**: Qwen CLI was forked from Gemini CLI, inheriting its core architecture, including the ReAct (reason-and-act) loop, Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, and terminal-first design. This explains why their interfaces, command structures, and features like codebase exploration, file operations, and workflow automation feel nearly identical.[](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)[](https://rits.shanghai.nyu.edu/ai/introducing-qwen-code-alibabas-open%25E2%2580%2591source-cli-for-agentic-coding-with-qwen3%25E2%2580%2591coder/)
- **Common Design Goals**: Both tools aim to provide developers with AI-powered coding assistance directly in the terminal, supporting tasks like code generation, refactoring, and git automation. They rely on Node.js (version 20+) and integrate with external tools via MCP, contributing to their similar user experience.[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
- **Open-Source Licensing**: Gemini CLI is licensed under Apache 2.0, allowing Qwen’s team to fork and modify it legally. Qwen CLI retains this license, adapting the original codebase to better suit Qwen3-Coder’s capabilities, such as improved parsing for code-specific tasks.[](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)[](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/)[](https://rits.shanghai.nyu.edu/ai/introducing-qwen-code-alibabas-open%25E2%2580%2591source-cli-for-agentic-coding-with-qwen3%25E2%2580%2591coder/)

### Were They Made by Someone Else or Contracted Out?
There’s no definitive evidence in the provided sources or broader web context to suggest that either Gemini CLI or Qwen CLI was contracted out or developed by a third party. Instead:
- **Gemini CLI**: Developed by Google, as stated in their official announcement and GitHub repository. It’s an open-source project designed to integrate Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model into terminal workflows, with contributions encouraged from the community.[](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/)[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
- **Qwen CLI**: Developed by Alibaba Cloud’s AI team, specifically the QwenLM team, as a fork of Gemini CLI. The fork was customized to leverage Qwen3-Coder models, with contributions acknowledged to the Gemini CLI team. There’s no indication of external contractors; the work appears to be in-house, building on Google’s open-source foundation.[](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)[](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/)[](https://rits.shanghai.nyu.edu/ai/introducing-qwen-code-alibabas-open%25E2%2580%2591source-cli-for-agentic-coding-with-qwen3%25E2%2580%2591coder/)

### Key Differences Despite Similarities
While their workflows are similar, Qwen CLI and Gemini CLI differ in:
- **Model Backend**: Gemini CLI uses Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, while Qwen CLI is optimized for Qwen3-Coder models (e.g., Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct).[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)[](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/)
- **Quotas and Access**: Gemini CLI offers a free tier with 1,000 requests/day via Google OAuth, while Qwen CLI provides a similar free quota (2,000 requests/day) via Qwen OAuth, with options for local deployment or Alibaba Cloud’s ModelScope.[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)
- **Optimizations**: Qwen CLI includes parser-level adaptations for Qwen3-Coder, enhancing code-specific tasks like deep codebase understanding and automation. Gemini CLI focuses on broader integration with Google’s ecosystem (e.g., Search, Vertex AI).[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)[](https://milvus.io/blog/hands-on-tutorial-build-your-own-coding-copilot-with-qwen3-coder-qwen-code-and-code-context.md)
- **Community Feedback**: Some developers note Qwen CLI’s superior performance in pure coding tasks due to its focus on code-specific optimizations, though it may struggle with certain MCP integrations (e.g., Playwright). Gemini CLI is praised for its ease of use and Google ecosystem integration but can require more manual guidance for complex tasks.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mub9r5/experiences_with_cc_codex_cli_qwen_coder_gemini/)[](https://aiagentstore.ai/compare-ai-agents/gemini-cli-vs-qwen3-coder)

### Conclusion
The similar functionality of Gemini CLI and Qwen CLI is due to Qwen CLI being a fork of Gemini CLI, with Alibaba’s team adapting it for their Qwen3-Coder models. Both were developed by their respective companies—Google for Gemini CLI and Alibaba Cloud for Qwen CLI—without clear evidence of third-party contracting. The differences lie in their model backends, specific optimizations, and ecosystem integrations, but the shared codebase ensures a nearly identical user experience. If you’re choosing between them, consider whether you prefer Google’s ecosystem and Gemini models or Qwen’s coding-focused optimizations and flexible deployment options.[](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)[](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/23/qwen-code-cli-vs-gemini-cli-which-one-is-better/)[](https://rits.shanghai.nyu.edu/ai/introducing-qwen-code-alibabas-open%25E2%2580%2591source-cli-for-agentic-coding-with-qwen3%25E2%2580%2591coder/)
