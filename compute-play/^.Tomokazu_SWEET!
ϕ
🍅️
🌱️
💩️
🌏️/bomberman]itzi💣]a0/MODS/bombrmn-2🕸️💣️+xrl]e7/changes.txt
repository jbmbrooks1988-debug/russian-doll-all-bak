i want to add optional multiple players (as ai on same map) 
for each player (including human) we are going to create/use weights/biases.txt (refer to #.checkers-rl.c or w/e its called)
in rl/ dir for them so we can train them.
for now just default to loading/editing same 1-5 player rl weights each game :

we need to make a pre menu before game start where player can pic ai players like so: 
    // Get number of players
    num_players = get_int_input("Enter number of players (1-5): ");
    while (num_players < 1 || num_players > 5) {
        printf("Invalid number of players. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\n");
        num_players = get_int_input("Enter number of players (1-5): ");
    }
    
    // Get player details
    for (int i = 1; i <= num_players; i++) {
        printf("\n--- Player %d ---\n", i);
        
        // Get player name
        get_string_input("Enter name: ", player_name, sizeof(player_name));
        
        // Get player type
        player_type = get_int_input("Enter player type (0 for Human, 1 for Computer): ");
        while (player_type != 0 && player_type != 1) {
            printf("Invalid player type. Please enter 0 for Human or 1 for Computer.\n");
            player_type = get_int_input("Enter player type (0 for Human, 1 for Computer): ");
        }
