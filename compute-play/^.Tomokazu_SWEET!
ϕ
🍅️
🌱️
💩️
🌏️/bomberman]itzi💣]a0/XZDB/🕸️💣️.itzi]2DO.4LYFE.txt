its taking a while

if its 2 fast somepony may get hurt!
maybe nice if enemies can throw them or something

Where you drop a ball whichcyou can slightly move down an obstacle course and if I  passed 59% of it, he'd let me go
After realizing it was a nightmare I calmed down
The cult was like, extreme kink chamber
But like rly extreme
Like fucking saw traps
====================================








i want this bomber man game to be in chinese , not ascii. also get rid of all emoji stuff. we dont have those and there taking up space in code. 3rd. lets add enemies , and progressively harder levels / (score) and items that can be used along with item menu and saving loading maps + player/enemy state as .csv
