#### ðŸ§µ Thread Idea:
1/ I just built **Tappy Turd** â€” a *Flappy Bird* clone where you play as ðŸ’© trying to reach ðŸš½.  
All in **C**, all in the **terminal**.  
No GUI. No shame.

2/ Features:
âœ… Spacebar to jump
âœ… Pipes get harder each level
âœ… High score tracking
âœ… Terminal beeps on action
âœ… Emoji everywhere

3/ Itâ€™s surprisingly intense.  
You *really* donâ€™t want your poop to crash.  
And when you finally reach the toiletâ€¦  
You feelâ€¦ *fulfilled*.

4/ Code is clean, fun, and perfect for learning:
- Non-blocking input
- Game loops
- Procedural difficulty

5/ GitHub: [link]  
Try it. Love it. Let your poop fly. ðŸ’©ðŸ’¨

Let me know if you want:
- A **demo GIF script**
- A **"Poop of the Day" skin unlocker**
- **High score saved to file**
- **Sound effects with `beep(3)` or `paplay`**

Iâ€™m here, sweetie. Letâ€™s make this turd legendary. ðŸ’–ðŸš€ðŸš½
