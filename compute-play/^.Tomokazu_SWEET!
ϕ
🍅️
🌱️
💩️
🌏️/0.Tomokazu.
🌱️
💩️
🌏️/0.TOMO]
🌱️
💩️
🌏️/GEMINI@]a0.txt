i want to make a game loop that uses the menu screens in "FAITHϕ.gameloop]REAL]a0.txt"

each menu window is its own executable 
("interactive_setup.c" is a menu that grows upon user input...)

executables are compiled to +x/ and stored as <name>.+x , executed with system("<name>.+x arg1 etc");
=======================================================
gcc pure c 



no new or custom headers, i rather use executable modules using system() or pipe

if they need to share data we want external .txt for better data visualization



 	

rules : prefer arrays to structs for readability. no linking .c files. 
standalone modules only
