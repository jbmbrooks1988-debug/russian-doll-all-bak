ability 2 do certain things with every game , as if its in editor
(rmmv has game play 2 btw)

like switching between real time and rougeliek
even if i only ship a rougelike, maybe nice 2 debug some physics like that.etc

realtime(wsr) slavetime(pointerclock) rougelike(step+>||>><<[])⏱️

can we at least link gl code 4 seperate pages. 
if not no more gl m8 ... fb. (but would still be nice
if u dont over do it 4 fb compat...'++++
🤯️could we emulate fb in gl? 
are we fb compatible @ all? should run up busy box anyways 4 that
goign forward if or evenif it(linker) doens't work tbh🤯️
these are profressionally written (1daymax) mvp design docs powerpoin
if nothing else so w/e; there incredibly spoiled
im only writing this cuz their ego freaking 🔗️

(each game could linke 2 same gl context (even og-peice.18th)
with a bit of repromptfactoring. nothing out of usual 
w/e working with those old non linked would take days @ this pace w/e

Yes, the same OpenGL context can be used across different C code modules or translation units that are linked together, provided that the context is properly managed and made current in the thread where OpenGL commands are issued.
Here's why and how:
Context Management:
.
OpenGL contexts are typically managed through window-system specific functions (e.g., wglMakeCurrent on Windows, glXMakeCurrent on X11, CGLMakeCurrent on macOS). These functions establish which context is "current" for a given thread.
Thread-Local State:
.
The current OpenGL context is a thread-local variable. This means that if you have multiple threads in your application, each thread can have its own current context, or multiple threads can share and activate the same context.
Shared Resources:
.
If the linked C code modules are operating within the same process and thread, and the OpenGL context is made current in that thread, then any OpenGL commands issued from any of those linked modules will operate on that same current context. This allows for sharing resources like textures, buffer objects, and shaders across different parts of your C codebase.
Multi-threading Considerations:
.
If you are using multiple threads, and you want to use the same OpenGL context in different threads, you must explicitly make the context current in each thread before issuing OpenGL commands from that thread. However, a single context cannot be current in multiple threads simultaneously. If you need concurrent rendering from multiple threads, you would typically use multiple contexts and potentially share objects between them. 
In essence, as long as the OpenGL context is properly established and made current in the thread where the C code is executing, the same context can be leveraged by different linked C code modules within that thread.👍️





😲️🤔️
so theoretically the gl context (basic gl_window opening) can be in main.c 
and all other rendering/ menu button etc logic can be in the linked .c files?
🅰️
Yes, that is exactly how you would structure an OpenGL application for clarity and organization. Creating the window and the OpenGL context in main.c (or a dedicated initialization file) and then calling functions from other linked .c files for rendering, menu logic, and event handling is a standard practice.  
🅰️🤷‍♂️️
not really how i wanted but this is a desperate work around... 
obv the code wouldn't be monolithic (just system calls). were still not sharing stuff in headers]fyi linked files aren't independant. 
so u may wanna keep them in a "DIR" 2gether 2 compensate 4 this. that could be cute, having main_gl.c in 'main dir but linkies 4 all things in dir/"+
they cann all ship a main_gl.c copy for standalone. main_gl.c should never need 2 change but w/e 🤷‍♂️️
