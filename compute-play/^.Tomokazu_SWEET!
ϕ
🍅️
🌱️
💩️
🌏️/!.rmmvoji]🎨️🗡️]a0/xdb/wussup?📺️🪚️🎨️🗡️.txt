i still love rmmv / tiling system in general 'makes sense...'
if u can do that (rmmv tiles in 'emopaint') u sould beable 2 do procgen 4 it 2

;btw im completely red pilled on waiting 4 our meta-master ai 2 be done
b4 worrying about new-kernel/riscv w/e cuz (compatability = ez user migration)+
onestly it(riscv/linux) will&should respectivli be the easist stuff 4 the ai 2do
(tho it would be hardest 2 progrma around as 'dummy data' ; get it? 🔍️
just like emojirmmv is ez. but trying 2 do asset rmmv was hard , get it? 🔍️
