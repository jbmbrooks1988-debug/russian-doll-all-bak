like switching between real time and rougeliek
even if i only ship a rougelike, maybe nice 2 debug some physics like that.etc

can we at least link gl code 4 seperate pages. 
if not no more gl m8 ... fb. (but would still be nice
if u dont over do it 4 fb compat...'++++
🤯️could we emulate fb in gl? 
are we fb compatible @ all? should run up busy box anyways 4 that
goign forward if or evenif it(linker) doens't work tbh🤯️
these are profressionally written (1daymax) mvp design docs powerpoin

(each game could linke 2 same gl context (even og-peice.18th)

Yes, the same OpenGL context can be used across different C code modules or translation units that are linked together, provided that the context is properly managed and made current in the thread where OpenGL commands are issued.
Here's why and how:
Context Management:
.
OpenGL contexts are typically managed through window-system specific functions (e.g., wglMakeCurrent on Windows, glXMakeCurrent on X11, CGLMakeCurrent on macOS). These functions establish which context is "current" for a given thread.
Thread-Local State:
.
The current OpenGL context is a thread-local variable. This means that if you have multiple threads in your application, each thread can have its own current context, or multiple threads can share and activate the same context.
Shared Resources:
.
If the linked C code modules are operating within the same process and thread, and the OpenGL context is made current in that thread, then any OpenGL commands issued from any of those linked modules will operate on that same current context. This allows for sharing resources like textures, buffer objects, and shaders across different parts of your C codebase.
Multi-threading Considerations:
.
If you are using multiple threads, and you want to use the same OpenGL context in different threads, you must explicitly make the context current in each thread before issuing OpenGL commands from that thread. However, a single context cannot be current in multiple threads simultaneously. If you need concurrent rendering from multiple threads, you would typically use multiple contexts and potentially share objects between them. 
In essence, as long as the OpenGL context is properly established and made current in the thread where the C code is executing, the same context can be leveraged by different linked C code modules within that thread.👍️





😲️🤔️
so theoretically the gl context (basic gl_window opening) can be in main.c 
and all other rendering/ menu button etc logic can be in the linked .c files?
🅰️
Yes, that is exactly how you would structure an OpenGL application for clarity and organization. Creating the window and the OpenGL context in main.c (or a dedicated initialization file) and then calling functions from other linked .c files for rendering, menu logic, and event handling is a standard practice.  
🅰️🤷‍♂️️


🇬🇮️ <- <- show an example of this using tappy_turd as an example. factor out to multiple linked files, so we can have less loc in each file, and prompt individual modules thru llm , better w/o confusing it with unrelated functions (no .h headers tho, i find them too abstract 4 this stage , 
if we need to share data among modules it should be easy because we shoud  write
 to an external file 
) :

i think it will all link into 1 ".+x" <-+ can compile seperate from solo's
then we can still call fork/pipe/ system("main_gl-o.+x");

🪚️
each gl can be cut down the middle (view/logic) into 2 .c linked files
to home.c <- same in every program  , very generic

and be called as aforkeed app from conductor
(which can show usage stats/data early cuz pwd/profiles/ 'users' etc <3)

view should aim to be as generic as possible as well 
+ setting up for "AR" shape rendering etc from 
(oft used thingi, then its context 4 prompt of single .c still , get iit?

1 conductor runs list of gl apps, 
and runs them in fork() if chosen
(will open resizable window but stay open these are 2 diff gl contexts
no need 2  share data back and forth , but can from file... w/e 

the point is , is possible cuz their diff windows .


get it . same in cli but windows. super cool imo. game changer. 
ive never seen a program like this on my computers. (wsr/logic opens windows but its 4 the same program) truly an exosys. do fb 4 it soon]b4uget carried away

i wanna seperate this monolithic gl app into 4 different linked .c files

1. main.c = extremely generic. only main() + gl context , no data or logic 
2. view_gl.c = extremely generic, only rendering no data or logic
3. model_gl.c = highly unique,only game logic and data to be used by view_gl
4. controller_gl.c = extremely generic , only controller input vars to be used by model_gl


finally lets compile it with a bash file,  "compilink.sh".

the aim is modularity and reuse. thats why home/view & controller should be extremely generic
model_gl will be unique to different games used in same pipeline, get it <3?

still wanna do rmmv tiles? 
well u need 2 read this first

not really how i wanted but this is a desperate work around... 
obv the code wouldn't be monolithic (just system calls). were still not sharing stuff in headers]fyi linked files aren't independant. 
so u may wanna keep them in a "DIR" 2gether 2 compensate 4 this. that could be cute, having main_gl.c in 'main dir but linkies 4 all things in dir/"+
they cann all ship a main_gl.c copy for standalone. main_gl.c should never need 2 change but w/e 🤷‍♂️️

ill ask gemini 2 do this first with 2 diff codes ie : zelda/candcrush

seperate them out 2 beable 2 use same
