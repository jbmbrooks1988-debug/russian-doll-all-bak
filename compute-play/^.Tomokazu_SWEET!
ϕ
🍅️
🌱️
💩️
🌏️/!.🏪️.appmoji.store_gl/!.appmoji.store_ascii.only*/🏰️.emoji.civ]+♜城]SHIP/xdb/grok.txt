🎪️<- barbarians?; no...🏕️<-barbarian⛺️<-settler

 this is an example of an emoji based candy crush clone that works perfectly on my machine. based on this model id like to create a 2d snes clone of the game civilization using emojis. we can start small. and will add features once we confirm functionality. land gen  + surround by water(start with settler , move or 'found city') next turn , gold , those ba sics should be enough.(then we will do 1 other city on same land island )
 
 ____________________
now lets do it in ascii. 

this is possible because we can render colors in background but still draw emojis in foreground.
