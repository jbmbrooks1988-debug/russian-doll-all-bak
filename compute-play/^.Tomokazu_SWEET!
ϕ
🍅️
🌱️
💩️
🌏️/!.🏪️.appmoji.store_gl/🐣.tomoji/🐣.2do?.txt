🪴️should have a tomo for plants> ?
because they should use the same data stucture
u should beable to open it from file


then later we can add stores and stuff 
(and wsr hook into this... get it ? diff hooks same mech

(and one thing that is "custom peice management thing like rmmv"
🪴️
sims ? person . take care of them, 
then make them also take care of plants(planets)
and eat from them
 this is whatwe were trying to do with peices. try again
 then u can pull the logic out🍅️🇸🇹️
 
 then ask how to manage multi?
(thru a diff kinda screen? 
(should all be mvc
then ask how to seperate individual functinos as plugins

(adhearing 2 close 2 data strct/13d window + menu
may have slowed us down {but tot alot}this is better 4 science=mid 2 late)


trainer battles? open world? transfer? 
this is our thing we wanted. 

and then ur gonna wanna have p2p / blockchain...so dont go 2 hard?
nah do w/e youll get they're by sword folding in datastructs u like
into old versions of code or w/e 🍴️
⚜️
fork off one of these 2 do full mr in. ez. why was this hard b4?
(gui actually makes it faster?)

make COMPLETE mr clone from menus, including spawn etc. 
then stuff will make sense. get it? 
then u can start pulling / refactoring code/data . its worth it.

+ giving pets chat bots? + giving them "bbsitters? or their own ai
(or rl, etc) ]LAB👩‍🔬️
🔫️
