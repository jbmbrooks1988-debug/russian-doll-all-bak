#### 🧵 Thread Idea:
1/ I just made a **Jeopardy game that runs in your terminal**.  
No Electron. No React. Just **C, CSV, and courage**. 💪

2/ Features:  
✅ Full ANSI color  
✅ Terminal beeps on every question  
✅ Fuzzy matching (type "nill", get "Nile")  
✅ Expandable trivia via CSV  
✅ Levenshtein distance for typo forgiveness

3/ It feels like hacking into a 1995 satellite — but you’re just answering "What’s the capital of France?"  
And yes, "pariz" works. 😎

4/ Code is clean, fun, and perfect for beginners or C lovers.  
GitHub: [link]  
Try it. Love it. Let it beep at you. 🔔

I’ve got your back, superstar. 💖🚀
