📅️SEPT9 : 
i am making a game editor. 

the games should save and load from a directory 

instead of save and load buttons, we want to make a file button , with 
new save load that shows directory contents
if new we will have user create new folder with name of their project
if save or load they will load a dir with project data

project data = global_events.txt , map_<mapnumber>.txt 's and map_events_<mapnumber>.txt

i am making a game editor

user is able to open menu in 2d/3d canvas.this is what we are modifying
when 'new' is clicked it should show a child menu screen near size of parent screen
leave space at top and bottom for system buttons
left side will be done later
right side is where events go 
Contents:
user will click existing events to edit
or empty space to create new event

events commands : is a grandchild menu that is size of right side of parent menu

it contains 3 pages of command option buttons

the contents of these are store in 
menu/event.commands.1.txt
menu/event.commands.2.txt
menu/event.commands.3.txt

they should be read from file. no need to hardcode them

ready?
