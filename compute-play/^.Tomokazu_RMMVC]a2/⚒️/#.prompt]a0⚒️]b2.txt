📅️SEPT9 : 
this is code for a game editor (using emojis). 

the games should save and load from a directory 

instead of save and load buttons, we want to make a file button , with 
sub options save load that shows directory contents
if 'new' we will have user create new folder with name of their project
if save we will update the project dir
 if load they will show dir picker & load a chosen dir with project data

project data = global_events.txt , map_<mapnumber>.txt 's and map_events_<mapnumber>.txt


underneath "tools" buttons, 
we will show a "temp dir display , showing all "maps" in project dir, 
clicking one of these maps (and their corresponding events edits)  will load that map into view 
for editing , the edits should be stored in temp/
dir within project  , until saved by user



do not modify any of the other code it works great but is fragile 2 modification.
pls use mvc . avoid structs prefer arrays. and no new .h files 


do you wanna read over the code, then write and have me approve a todo list before writing it to todo.txt?
then upon approval we will do each list item , careful to make
a backup zip tar before each new step, for safety. 

optional additional reading for context (ignore if confusing) : 
______________________________________________

currently program looks more like a "paint" than game-editor because
we haven't created events yet, but that will be our next step
and we will want to save/load them as well. 


events : user programmed events 

use ? :next we are going to create a "player.c" gameloop
that can read "save dir" and play the users game using the data. 

events dictate the behaviors of the objects

feel free to give guidance/code-hooks towards this next stage as well
after.

pls use mvc . avoid structs prefer arrays. and no new .h files

i am making a game editor

user is able to open menu in 2d/3d canvas.this is what we are modifying
when 'new' is clicked it should show a child menu screen near size of parent screen
leave space at top and bottom for system buttons
left side will be done later
right side is where events go 
Contents:
user will click existing events to edit
or empty space to create new event

events commands : is a grandchild menu that is size of right side of parent menu

it contains 3 pages of command option buttons

the contents of these are store in 
menu/event.commands.1.txt
menu/event.commands.2.txt
menu/event.commands.3.txt

they should be read from file. no need to hardcode them

ready?
