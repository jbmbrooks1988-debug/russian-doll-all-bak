# Emoji Paint - Refactored for Beginner Readability

This is a refactored version of the Emoji Paint application that replaces complex struct usage with simpler array-based approaches to improve readability for beginners.

## Changes Made

### 1. EventMenuItem Struct Refactoring
- **Before**: Used a struct with fields (label, id, is_category, page)
- **After**: Replaced with byte array approach using helper functions
- **Benefit**: Easier to understand memory layout and access patterns

### 2. EventMenu Struct Updates
- **Before**: Contained EventMenuItem* items pointer
- **After**: Updated to work with array-based menu items (void* items)
- **Benefit**: Consistent with new array-based approach

### 3. InputEvent Struct Refactoring
- **Before**: Used a struct with union for different event types
- **After**: Replaced with integer array approach
- **Benefit**: Eliminates complexity of unions and type casting

### 4. InputBinding Struct Refactoring
- **Before**: Used a struct with fields (key, modifiers, action, description)
- **After**: Replaced with integer array approach
- **Benefit**: Simplifies memory management and access

### 5. UIElement Struct Refactoring
- **Before**: Used a struct with multiple fields including color array
- **After**: Replaced with integer array approach with separate color storage
- **Benefit**: Makes field access more explicit and easier to understand

### 6. Maintained As-Is
- **GameObject struct**: Already used arrays for attributes, so left unchanged
- **ModelContext struct**: Complex struct kept as-is for now (next refactoring target)

## Files Modified
- `event_menu.c`: EventMenuItem and EventMenu refactoring
- `controller_gl.c`: InputEvent and InputBinding refactoring
- `view_gl]3d]a0.c`: UIElement refactoring

## Compilation
The project compiles successfully using the provided script:
```bash
./xh.compile.dir.link.+xðŸ“¿]c3.sh
```

## Next Refactoring Target

The next step is to refactor the **ModelContext struct**, which is a complex struct containing many fields. This would involve:

1. Identifying which fields can be grouped into arrays
2. Replacing the struct with array-based storage
3. Creating helper functions for field access
4. Updating all references throughout the codebase

**Prompt for ModelContext Refactoring:**
"Refactor the ModelContext struct in model_gl.c to use arrays instead of a complex struct. The ModelContext contains many fields like canvas_rows, canvas_cols, tile_size, num_emojis, etc. Identify logical groupings of fields that can be converted to arrays, replace the struct with array-based storage, create helper functions for accessing fields, and update all references throughout the codebase. Focus on making the code more readable for beginners while maintaining all functionality."
