the menu system is "REALLY BAD"

its jacked up in general but also bad 4 prompt engineering. 


they gave some ideas , just make sure u make a menu standard
then u can put them in game 2 . were making an game-editor
so theres no reason 2 skimp here, then we can use it forever. ♾️

when we started introducing structs we fucked up 
but now with this linking and shit, its unreadable 4 real
. its very simple. arrays are readable. structs are still unreadable
what a sad wasted experiment.

>strux spanning multiple pages of code is my hell...
>i cant even help formulate questions cuz i cant read the shit. 

>if u just say no structs u can avoid having to read
literally 10 extra differnt kind of fucked up OOP(s) data types
sad. 😭️

u should have just insisted no structs
the same way u did with no headers, 
this could have been a nice codebase , instead
its an unreadable night mare now. sad. 
{and they think its funny btw, and literally 
have physically assaulted and schizo encouraged
in that direction i despite so much proof 2 contraray i hat ethem so much even now they started stomping on my fuckni hed again. i haate them so much they will die and go 2 hell they are so evil and oblvious 2 reality and selfish; and cluless/careless/stupid 2 boot🤬️😷️💉️ }
