⚡️i may make simpler 'text only events menu'
just 2 write 2 player data test, then impliment them in 
rmvc3d.why not then we have both, 1 4 ascii thats cool🥸️😎️ right? (thats the way imo but they love vis.🔍️
-> this is vis bruh... <- i WANT to do this.🔍️
⚡️🤩️start NOW!🥳️📯️✨️ (use dante.xt) 📟️ helpscripting🆘️

+ maybe we could swap / xp better of data strux 📁️🏷️
remember btw were making peices.mc.wu by making MSR🧭️
⚠️
events has nothing 2 do with anything gl. , yet
its hug3 4 player. 
get that shit out into its own linked moduel.

also i wanna do blender like scripting SOON 

even before worrying about w/e gui bs 
(cuz i can use it for other things 2 ) 
⚠️
▶️
in player/data/test_project we want to add
'starting position' so the player starts in the world
and so that when arrow keys are pressed
their player is moved
(use a 😃️ emoji as default, we will change it later)

also obviously we have to modify player_main.c
and any associates to accomodate this important foundational update.▶️
>
if u start over in fb, (fraembuffer)
just make brwoser first and work backwards
then they can all use the same layout scheme...

🛑️
thumb or nothing else can be added
qwen gets confused. 
we need a better more modular fraemwork for doing menus


🛑️

nothing is showing up in player. its
having a really hard time with it but thats dumb. 
this is a good jumpoff point tho for some
kind of architectural wizardry or w/e
i believe in and like the editor
if it was "modular" it would be readable
and promptable...

*make sure it has a switch from 2d/3d in data
or else testing will be harder.

📮️
if u need a bit more juice u may need to ask 4 refactor; even 4 understanding..may need 2 ask it
2 do our own window scheme based on html? w/e or do in playe rfirst w/e 
🛸️its better than anyone ever paid for w/e🛸️ 
📮️
🪟️
also if u want a "menu as start screen" or something else, that should be programed
in editor tbh. then we cna literal make chatrooms and stuff in editor get it? 
🪟️🎟️; 2d/3d in data is working. so yea, maybe everythign should 'start in data first'
this is a lab man dont beat urself up🎟️
👍️
player is completely independant of editor. so who gives a frick if we made a new editor or w/e
⏯️btw u could make a diff player 2 . make one in halo/fb/gb/webgl w/e 

web-gl maybe less messy 4 both tbh.. .
