(how could it hurt 2 have a 'versatile 3d game (2d or 3d realtime/tactics
single player/ multi + ai or df ai management screens etc
depending on mode. for labbing. data prep , etc. 
+ adding scripting in tegrating tight ai into event loop etc
🪓️
use z levels and seperate data sheet for maps. +2d-view swap & rougelike
aim 2 backwards compat with peices/rmmv, this is just a lab.

>event loop etc

<honestly we want to make a "tactics" version of minecraft in 3d /2d
that shows availiable move space
(no we want o beable 2 switch between real time or tactics.
and still allow multiparty management. + ai builds mvp fast so lets go

(we can work out a plugin system, and use rmmv plugs (may use as player)
<and gives us versatility (ie unity/vs unreal compat/xchange rate)
(we can de construct etc
>>ill probably have diff forks of this

(and somehow later impose login screen + profile pre game start
(ie 'app starter screen'🪓️

🪵️
honestlly this is a better place long term 2 drop in chemi
visualization etc. cuz u should have commited 2 this codebase
and have ways where u have figured out how to "data orb-break"
out important micro-macro mechanical blox...
rmmvc is good 2 we want compatibility this isn't a competition its code..
< should all be used as tools to give us speed/ synergy +fun etc>]STOKED
🪵️

(i want emoji 2 look 3d from all sides <- llm-vis does this
we can do this for items. + we have an image voxelizer
+ we can fractal break things up.


can we use chinese or emojis but have text at bottom on hover?
