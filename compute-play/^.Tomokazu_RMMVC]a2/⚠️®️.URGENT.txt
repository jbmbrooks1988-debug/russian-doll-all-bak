⚠️®️
when u do this over, 
main window should load "tiles" 
(u can specify their size ie 36 42 or w/e and it will just make tabs
for everything in "dir" <- so u could use all rmmv for 1 map. 
or u could 'load treatments.txt' for how tiles shold be treated (get it? ) 
®️
and the others are smoller pickers are colors and emojis 
®️
& a picker for "obj placement" 
®️
and we will have loader here for loading w/e obj, fbx or custom "treatment" as well
