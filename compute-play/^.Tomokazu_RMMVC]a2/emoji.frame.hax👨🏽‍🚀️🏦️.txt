👨🏽‍🚀️is there something we can do to stop emojis from rendering every frame in opengl . it slows down my emoji paint program...view_gl]3d]a0.cThought for 38sThe performance bottleneck in your Emoji Paint program is almost certainly due to the repeated texture generation and deletion inside render_emoji and render_emoji_3d_quad. These functions are called every frame (in display()) for every visible emoji on the canvas, in the sidebar palette, in tabs, and potentially in UI elements. FreeType's FT_Load_Char and OpenGL's glGenTextures/glTexImage2D/glDeleteTextures are expensive operations—loading glyph bitmaps and uploading them to the GPU multiple times per second will tank frame rates, especially with a larger canvas or more emojis.

The fix is to preload and cache textures for all emojis once at initialization, then reuse them in rendering. Since get_num_emojis() returns a fixed (small) set of emojis, this is straightforward and efficient. Here's how to implement it step by step. I'll provide code snippets to integrate directly into your existing file.👨🏽‍🚀️🪚️= cacheflow💱️🏦️🤖️
