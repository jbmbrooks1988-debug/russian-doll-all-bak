sept 6. 
optomized emojis, 
added raycasting . 
fixed cam ctrls a bit

cons : 
so ray cast is going but its interfereing with menu picker in 3d <-
thinks im trying to pick ray [instead of emoji/options](2d/3d toggle works tho)

> take out "sides" in grid but leave squares = 3dchess♟️❤️‍🔥️💞️
<- this shoudl allow better "plane picking" as well... ❤️‍🔥️💞️
>rotate 45.o and make sure its"horizontal"

>still haven't added "thumbs"scroll
> align more with rmmv {tabs} including save/load maps


>show grok files. tell it ur making game engine mvc. or no w/e

>rigt click on "objects" pulls up menu (even in 2d)<-event menu

> add "ar" toggle at least 4 tsots etc. u make utube...try it 4 data📹️


>i wanna finsih wsr. 
>i wanna do peices. 
> refactor cache monopoly/zelda-rouge/esp civ 
> then go back to "META_MASTER" ideas...
> can open(mod?) 18th files seperately , btw. 

>go crazy prompting entire universe "solar sys gravity/flight/space
/cars / ppl gta7"using just emoji blocks. 
> minecraft + chem craft + magicraft

>remake chimochio / solpen "INSIDE RMMVC" y  ? level genetc tools=ez.
help ai. try 2 integrate. teach ai natively then if we hook in
ollama later we can charge ppl like windsurf.and it will helpem.

>training our chat bot. start making chat in c . +web supabase?

>wanna do macro TSOTS app window.

The fix is to preload and cache textures for all emojis once at initialization, then reuse them in rendering. Since get_num_emojis() returns a fixed (small) set of emojis, this is straightforward and efficient.

dont forget lfs and framebuffer.
ur making sick progress even if u dont "see/feel" it ]mvc/emojiopt


going 2 market isn't a bad thing, can we do pre wishlist

raycaster barely on. break it up w/e
and reprompt smoller . its alreayd linked m8 . 
+ super close 2 "end goals of 3d (maybe THE end)
not counting dumb liil stuff , even ar is ez  right? 

(use early ass example or w/e ez]glu

! weve done raycasters b4. 
it maybe obscured by 2 many blocks but read thru the code
most of it is super legit.

-------------
thumb scroll... more tight pro looking stuff
