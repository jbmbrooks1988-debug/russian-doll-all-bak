how is it reading from map? 
there doesnt even seem 2 be xyz coords in map
yet it goes 2 the right place? 
(the labels must not be right , but then ... how does it know colors?


after that. can we do new projects? save? 

if so lets do events(.c?) <a scratch-esq language ide >
and "player.c"	<"the interpreter>


----
A language that executes code without needing a compiler is called an
interpreted language. These languages use a program called an interpreter, which reads the source code line-by-line and executes each command directly.  ie :scripted? (.txt we do it all the time)
