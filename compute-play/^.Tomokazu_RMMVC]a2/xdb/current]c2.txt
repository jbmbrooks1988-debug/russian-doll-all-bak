we want it so that we can program any 2d / 3d game
and somehow use "player infra"(even if we didn't use playscript.c)

so that we could show qwen the "player_mvc.c"
and it can write "everything else for the game" 
(instead of showing it 'rmmvc or 18th or another game or w/e')
(maximum reuse/ compat and hell, probly helps showing playscript)

PLAYSCRIPT should be very similiar 2 HALO/NETLIST if possible 
otherwise , similiar 2 c/javascript.

(its at this point we can make a proper menu system(mousemovable)
and even may use 'html'
and at that point we can recursively refactor, and 
even do this with other things (18th etc) or w/e in futuer <3💖️🏆️

wed like to add "meta_scripting" @ some point
2 control entire emoji_paint (same thing blender has)
basically we will trigger many of the same functions.
but we also want it so doing stuff writes "script"
of all actions done(blender does this 2 ) 
and we wanna be doing that will all programs. so ai can do stuff.
(like make us games)
{all our srs programs should have it but, this is a good startspot}✨️
honestly i wanna get this rolling very soon after first few events.

🚵‍♀️️(we also wanna add terrain "rules" tab)since we include NONE 
🚵‍♀️️


💯️(i did menu window loading 2day(sept10 = 10 days rmmv 20wsr...
if the fin sim was harder 2 do
what does that tell u about the fim sin?
🤨💰️i wanna go back. also wanna pull up ai(s) 2 reach & play 🎉️

theres alredy a few menus. are the "modular" or hardcoded structures? 
ask . 
how to make them more generic if so? <- good idea, isnt' done cuz we had stack smash right click.💣️
⏳️
(woudl truly like them to beable 2 be replaced by a .txt file of "markup"
w/e tho . maybe we can invert after we figure out save games/exports⏳️

export is jsut "player.+x (plus w/e else) + dir/game.jsons, 

they do html for compat..
they also do win. w/e kiss 4 now. do it soon tho💣️
7️⃣️
honestly our  goal should be 2 get back into ai/llm asap
so we can put in in our major aps (tho they should be ready 4 it..); ergo pls make a simple game IN RMMVC3d so we can ai.hook back l8r


<- i just want to get event loop for WSR&RMMVC done...and inject simple ai 4 peices/corps. 
we we can hook the ai up to something and have awareness of data..++ if both are playable <3

 pull WSR 2 QWEN-DEB 4 NOS🏍️🛑️

(we could probably pull peices back 2 rmmv? )

Y ? i do wanna do rmmvc3d clone.i just wanna make sure
we accomodate all the data structs... and are up 2 speed y not? 

(dont rmmv teach u bad habits. gameprogrm needn't be in map.json)

also we can push more into daw. /image diffusion= animation : SPRITE FROM EMOJI/WORDCORPUS+-(googimg)🧚️
and even image gen thru pixel cloning
and even chatai/meta ai.


+
i wanna sus out more features for wsr 
and sus out monopoly + hax and compare (monopoly spex is tm)
+ sus out the tamogotchis in diff directions...
(sus out a 'multi tamo playground type deal (mem ,etc) right?🐣️

>theres still no ppl in wsr. but i want org charts etc. qwen?

also wanna make p2p infra that allows uploading of "shorts"+torrents
supabase hax, crypto , etc💱️

>also we have incrementals auto running. 
if sp did that we coudl guide it to dump dustopedia stuff 
on staticish site hooks. and build out site even pre login
as some sort of one man portfolio on steroids type deal 
(obv will rebrand page but 4 now that blurb is fine executively)

sept 6. 
optomized emojis, 
added raycasting . 
fixed cam ctrls a bit

cons : 
so ray cast is going but its interfereing with menu picker in 3d <-
thinks im trying to pick ray [instead of emoji/options](2d/3d toggle works tho)

> take out "sides" in grid but leave squares = 3dchess♟️❤️‍🔥️💞️✅️
<- this shoudl allow better "plane picking" as well... ❤️‍🔥️💞️✅️
>rotate 45.o and make sure its"horizontal"

>still haven't added "thumbs"scroll
> align more with rmmv {tabs} including save/load maps



> add "ar" toggle at least 4 tsots etc. u make utube...try it 4 data📹️


>i wanna finsih wsr. 
>i wanna do peices. 
> refactor cache monopoly/zelda-rouge/esp civ +BIG4 .2 experiemnt.leave 1.tamo?
(4 science)
> then go back to "META_MASTER" ideas...
> can open(mod?) 18th files seperately , btw. 

>go crazy prompting entire universe "solar sys gravity/flight/space
/cars / ppl gta7"using just emoji blocks. 
> minecraft + chem craft + magicraft

>remake chimochio / solpen "INSIDE RMMVC" y  ? level genetc tools=ez.
help ai. try 2 integrate. teach ai natively then if we hook in
ollama later we can charge ppl like windsurf.and it will helpem.

>training our chat bot. start making chat in c . +web supabase?

>wanna do macro TSOTS app window. 

💳️
The fix is to preload and cache textures for all emojis once at initialization, then reuse them in rendering. Since get_num_emojis() returns a fixed (small) set of emojis, this is straightforward and efficient.

dont forget lfs and framebuffer.
ur making sick progress even if u dont "see/feel" it ]mvc/emojiopt


going 2 market isn't a bad thing, can we do pre wishlist
user surveys somehow into crm?

> we want normal events/ rpg items. 
but what about elements/ elemental magic? ai? (all plugins
treat RMMV the same way u treat WSR . build complete clone first + w/e(3d ofc)
then do addonts. even as plugins ,w/e 

we get tons of speed/momentum/sos from cloning.

 ultimately ur looking for some kind of .txt gui based scripting , right? ❤️‍🔥️
 (and that can parse 2 "WRAITH" also)
 
 protip? : i would do one thing at a time 
 build it in c first as MVC , then theoretically u can load "V" from file.txt
 right? 
 ai can help u with that no problem.wuts the point? 
 
 io cohesion if nothing else tbh. (std io api's tbh) get it?
