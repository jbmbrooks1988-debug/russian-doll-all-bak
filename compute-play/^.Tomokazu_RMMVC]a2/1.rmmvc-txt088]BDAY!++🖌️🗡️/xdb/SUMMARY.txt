MAP SAVING ISSUE FIX - SUMMARY
==============================

PROBLEM FIXED:
The application was overwriting map_0.txt when saving other maps, causing data loss.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The save_project() function was hardcoded to always save to "map_0.txt" regardless of which map was currently loaded.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. FIXED save_project() function in controller_gl.c:
   - Now saves to the currently loaded map file (current_map_file) instead of always saving to map_0.txt
   - Provides clear user feedback showing which file was saved
   - Added debug output for troubleshooting
   - Proper error handling and memory management

2. ENHANCED save_game_state() function in model_gl.c:
   - Prioritizes using current_map_file when set and valid
   - Only generates new filenames when no current map is loaded
   - Preserves fallback behavior for debug cases

RESULT:
- Application correctly tracks and saves to the currently loaded map file
- No more overwriting of existing maps
- Users can safely create, edit, and save multiple maps without data loss
- Clear feedback shows which file was saved

COMPILATION STATUS:
Successfully compiled without warnings.

PENDING FEATURES:
Scale and dimension editing and saving in objects has not yet been implemented. This includes:
- Headerbar options for scale and dimension editing
- Input fields for [xyz] * [1] (in header , supposed to be editable on click inside)
- Currently the input fields don't accept input when clicked
- This functionality still needs to be implemented

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION - SCALE AND DIMENSION EDITING:
When implementing the scale and dimension editing feature, the following will need attention:

Files that likely need modification:
1. controller_gl.c - For input handling and UI interaction
2. model_gl.c - For storing and managing scale/dimension data
3. view_gl]3d]a0.c - For rendering scaled objects
4. event_menu.c - For UI elements and menu options

Areas to focus on:
- Making input fields responsive to mouse clicks
- Implementing + / - 1:1 controls for scaling
- Adding header options for dimension editing
- Saving scale/dimension data with map files
- Loading scale/dimension data when loading maps

The map saving issue has been resolved and is ready for testing, but the scale/dimension editing feature remains to be implemented.
