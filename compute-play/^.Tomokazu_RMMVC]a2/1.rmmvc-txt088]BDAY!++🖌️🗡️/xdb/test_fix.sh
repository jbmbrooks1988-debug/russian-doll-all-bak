echo "To manually test the fix:"
echo "1. Run the application: ./1.PRO_v2]b1]m60.+x"
echo "2. Create a new project"
echo "3. Create a new map (should create map_0.txt)"
echo "4. Add some content to the map"
echo "5. Save the map (should save to map_0.txt, not create a new file)"
echo "6. Create another map (should create map_1.txt)"
echo "7. Switch between maps and verify content is preserved"
echo "8. Save each map and verify it updates the correct file"

echo "Expected behavior after fix:"
echo "- Saving a map should update the same file it was loaded from"
echo "- No overwriting of existing maps should occur"
echo "- Each map file should maintain its identity"
