i want  jbmbrooks 2 run this (like a tsots demo game)

and it should use a mini in browser llm or w/e 2 generate 
prices (along with sine and other stuff "FSM" )

(this was kinda flirted with in MBA. but u could do better)
(its best suggests using real hist prices 2 gen new 4 corp)

📯️could do right now
🇬🇮️

in pure gcc c , i want to take as arg 1 file like TSLA.txt and generate a TSLA_GEN.txt file using a machine learning / ai algo that generates 50 new numbers using the same volatility  from the input  ; which ml algo is best for doing something like that?lstm ? something else? code?
💭️🅰️
A simple approach could be computing average change and standard deviation, then generating new numbers.

LSTM might work for time series prediction, but implementing it in C is complex.


Perhaps recommend a simpler approach, since full LSTM in C is complex for the user.
Evaluating AR(1) model
An AR(1) model fits well with a=0.269, b=0.982, and R-squared 0.95.

Autoregressive_model
ar(1) model from en.wikipedia.org
In statistics, econometrics, and signal processing, an autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process.

this is cool , but now i wanna make a version that gens completely from scratch . ie it makes up 4 random letters 4 ticker symbol. it sets an initial price randomly , sets an initial beta randomly then generates 50 prices, ideally each gen should be unique enough that they look like historical stock prices off completely different equities, so if u know anytricks to include 4 realistic variety , pls include them
-----

these just go up. there is no volatility (beta) etc, that would be in real stock prices. how can we augment this ? sine / Fibonacci , etc? what is standard in generating fake realistic stock price?
🅰️
Geometric Brownian Motion is standard for generating fake stock prices with drift and volatility.
Searching for "standard methods to generate synthetic realistic stock price data"

Understanding the request
The request is to create a version that generates stock data from scratch.

It needs a random 4-letter ticker symbol, initial price, and beta.

The generation should produce 50 prices that look like historical stock prices of different equities.

Each run should be unique, with realistic variety included.

Let's search for ways to simulate realistic stock price movements.
Exploring simulation methods
Additive random walk with drift might work, but starting high helps avoid negatives.

Geometric Brownian motion could be better for realistic stock price simulation.

Initial price can range from 0 to 200.0, rounded to one decimal place.

Beta randomization ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 for AR(1) model persistence.

For variety, consider randomizing drift and volatility to mimic different market conditions.

Using different seeds ensures each run produces unique price series.
Enhancing variety in simulations
Randomly choose from four types: upward trend, downward trend, volatile sideways, or mean-reverting.

An AR(1) model predicts a variable based on its immediate past value, while an AR(2) model uses its two most recent past values. The choice between them depends on the data's underlying structure and whether past dependencies extend beyond the previous period. If an AR(1) model doesn't adequately capture serial correlation, moving to an AR(2) model provides the additional predictive power of the second-lagged value. 
AR(1) Model (First-Order Autoregressive)
Equation: Yt = β0 + β1Yt-1 + ut* 
Description: The current value (Yt) is a function of a constant (β0), its immediately preceding value (Yt-1), and a random error term (ut). 
When to Use: Useful for time series where the most recent past value has a significant impact on the current value. 
AR(2) Model (Second-Order Autoregressive)
Equation: Yt = β0 + β1Yt-1 + β2Yt-2 + et 
Description: The current value (Yt) depends on the constant (β0), the value from one period ago (Yt-1), and the value from two periods ago (Yt-2), plus an error term (et). 
When to Use: Appropriate when both the immediately preceding value and the value from two periods prior are important for predicting the current value. 
Key Differences & Considerations
Lagged Variables:
The primary difference is the number of lagged (past) values of the dependent variable used as predictors. 
Complexity:
AR(2) is a more complex model than AR(1) as it includes an additional predictor. 
Data-Driven Choice:
The choice between AR(1) and AR(2) is determined by analyzing the time series data, often using tools like the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to identify significant lags. 
Order of Autoregressive Models:
An AR(p) model, in general, includes 'p' lagged values as predictors. 
This video explains the basics of AR models, including AR(1) and AR(2):


🅰️
To incorporate an AR(2) model, and occasionally an AR(3) model, for generating more realistic stock price swings, we can extend the previous approach. An AR(2) model uses the past two prices to predict the next, capturing more complex dynamics like momentum or reversals, while an AR(3) model adds a third lag for even richer patterns, such as longer-term oscillations. This is suitable for stock prices, as real equities often show autocorrelations beyond just the immediate prior value, leading to more realistic swings. We'll randomly choose between AR(2) and AR(3) for each generation to ensure variety, and we'll continue using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) or Geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) framework for the stochastic component, adjusted for volatility. The initial price will remain log-uniform between 0.01 and 100000, and volatility will be randomized as before. The seed file will also record whether AR(2) or AR(3) was used, along with the coefficients.
The AR(2) model for the log-price $   y_t = \ln(P_t)   $ is:
$   y_t = \mu + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \sigma \epsilon_t,   $
where $   \epsilon_t \sim N(0,1)   $, and the price is $   P_t = \exp(y_t)   $. For AR(3), we add $   \phi_3 y_{t-3}   $. To ensure stationarity (realistic bounded swings), we constrain the coefficients: $   |\phi_1 + \phi_2| < 1   $, $   |\phi_2| < 1   $, and $   \phi_1 + \phi_2 + \phi_3 < 1   $ for AR(3). The cyclical type will use a sinusoidal component in the mean to mimic periodic behavior.
The code below updates the previous version to use AR(2) or AR(3) randomly, with the same five trend types (Growing, Dying, Volatile Sideways, Mean-Reverting, Cyclical). It writes the generated prices to GEN/<TICKER>_GEN.txt and the parameters (including AR order and coefficients) to GEN/<TICKER>_seed.txt. Compile with gcc program.c -o program -lm and run as ./program.

ok . finally i want to make a 3rd program . one that makes predictions based on the data in GEN/  for each set. it should buy/hold or sell (just like user) each round and write output to prediction/rounds.txt. as "ticker, round,month purchase, trend_prediction" (and anything else im forgetting?)
 additionally it should write prediction_<ticker>.png along with the final gl chart  view (including prices , green and red signals for holding p&l) and its prediction. get it? this will be 6.predictions]a0.c
