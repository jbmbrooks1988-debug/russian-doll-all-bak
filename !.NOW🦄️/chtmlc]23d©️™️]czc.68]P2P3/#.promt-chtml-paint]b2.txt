<we should update the other 2 archs whenever we modify mvc> 
==============================
this is our framework : chtml
we made it from scratch to render chtml gui in open gl.we use it to hold gui seperately so we can prompt smaller contexts 
and get more focused code outputs from llms.
its an "mvc" architecture :
currently it has a horizontal slider, but does not go vertical (as far as i know) 
can we make the framework support a vertical slider somehow. (we can edit mvc code to alter framework) ?
2.
heres the test
(we want to make sure we can specify a starting slider value : 1 )
then  we want to send its value (1-255) to a canvas in module/.c that will show a 120x120 square color canvas of the 255 color value (the slider should be verticle next to this color canvas
 3.
 lets do a slightly more sophisticated demo of the slider and 27 color canvas: 
will show 9 40x40 (120x120)color squares at a time depending on position of the slider 

we should test its correspondence with canvas so
when user clicks the canvas there should be a text element telling color and its index number, that was clicked

they will beable to place the chosen color in the "level canvas"

it is supposed to work like :
@color-flex-tut-2/color-picker-tut.html & its js



we will compile test when appropriate and save zip tar to /back

CAUTION : 
    // Convert window coordinates to OpenGL                     
       //  coordinates for proper Y direction                                
   int opengl_y = convert_y_to_opengl_coords(y);               
         // Convert window y to OpenGL y          
───────────────────────────╯

additionally on the level canvas there should be a "🗡️"  that is movable with arrow keys  ( and c/v)z&x=lvl
"🚴🏽‍♂️️" emoji as playable character (can jump , not fly)
and 2 "👻️" ai characters



we dont need flex yet ,we just need to do the color render in canvas + a "thumb scroll

this is our framework : chtml
we made it from scratch to render chtml gui in open gl.we use it to hold gui seperately so we can prompt smaller contexts 
and get more focused code outputs from llms.
its an "mvc" architecture :


we would like it to work to beable to do what

   and its javascript file are doing , "pretending our .chtml is the html , and our module.c is the .js file) 
we want the code to work as similiarly as possible, so developers can go back and forth without confusion . get it? 

(lets remake the .html project in chtml as a proof that we are moving the chtml framework to be closer in line with
html / css / js


how ? show a canvas with colors and use slider to scroll the (starting slider at "0")

 we need the same functionality        
   that means 120x120 window of 40x40 square color pickers with       
   thumb scroll (existing slider is fine)  to view more and printing of selected color           
   under on selection. this would be copy and prove we are ready 


   when color is picked its  'written' on screen. also thumb  can be a regular slider all 
     it has to do is communicate with module for what colors to display. 
     (that way it could be placed anywhere else on screen, this is most  
    html/js like solution) can u do that thats teh best supreme solution , get it?  

we will compile test when appropriate and save zip tar to /back
also chtml_legend.md should be updated when a new html like feature is implimented

turns out we shouldn't even really be doing color picker yet (its not that hard )
⁉️
the real thing is : 
 we need better ipc, it currently passes "shape , x,y (no z;lol wtf) etc " its moronic
can we pass a variable size array , or labled item each time? this is supposed to accomodate everything from
dynamic webpages, simple 2d games with a few vars, to full triple a games with tons of differnt vars,

how do you recommend we modify our ipc (model.c ) to be more extensible going forward?
