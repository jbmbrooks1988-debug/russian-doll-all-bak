# CHTML MVC Architecture

## Overview
The CHTML MVC framework is designed as a development platform for applications that separates GUI, logic, and boilerplate code into distinct components. This modular architecture enables prompting of smaller, focused contexts rather than monolithic applications, while maintaining human readability.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Structure

#### Model (`2.model.c`)
- **Purpose**: Contains application logic and data manipulation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handles data structures and business logic
  - Processes application-specific operations
  - Communicates with external modules via process pipes
  - Maintains state separate from GUI presentation
- **Implementation**: Contains shape data structures, directory operations, and data processing functions
- **Strengths**: Well-separated from GUI concerns, focused on data and logic
- **Shortcomings**: Could benefit from more explicit data encapsulation and clearer state management patterns

#### View (`3.view.c`)  
- **Purpose**: Handles GUI rendering and presentation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Renders UI elements using OpenGL
  - Processes coordinate transformations
  - Parses CHTML files to create UI
  - Manages visual appearance of elements
- **Implementation**: Contains rendering functions, coordinate system handling, and UI element display
- **Strengths**: Complete separation from business logic, handles complex coordinate transformations
- **Shortcomings**: Large single file, could benefit from component-based rendering

#### Controller (`4.controller.c`)
- **Purpose**: Handles user input and coordinates between model and view
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processes mouse, keyboard, and special key events
  - Handles UI interactions and element events
  - Coordinates between model and view components
  - Manages application state and workflow
- **Implementation**: Contains event handlers and state management for UI interactions
- **Strengths**: Clear separation of input handling from rendering and logic
- **Shortcomings**: Could benefit from more modular event handling and better state management patterns

### 2. Modular Design Elements

#### CHTML GUI System (`1.main_prototype_a1.c`)
- **Purpose**: Main application entry point and module orchestration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initializes MVC components
  - Orchestrates module execution
  - Handles inter-process communication with modules
- **Strengths**: Provides clear entry point and modular execution flow
- **Shortcomings**: Could benefit from more explicit module registration and dependency management

#### Module System
- **Purpose**: Enables external application logic through separate processes
- **Implementation**: Uses process pipes with input.csv and output.csv for communication
- **Strengths**: Complete separation of GUI from application logic, enables external modules
- **Shortcomings**: File-based IPC may be slower than shared memory, lacks error handling for module failures

### 3. Requirements Fulfillment

#### ✅ Separation of GUI, Logic, and Boilerplate:
- **GUI (View)**: Completely in `3.view.c` with rendering and CHTML parsing
- **Logic (Model)**: In `2.model.c` with data structures and processing
- **Boilerplate (Controller)**: In `4.controller.c` with event handling and coordination

#### ✅ Modular Prompting:
- Each component can be understood independently
- Smaller context windows needed for specific operations
- Clear interfaces between components for focused prompting

#### ✅ Human Readability:
- Clear file naming conventions
- Descriptive function and variable names
- Logical organization of code by component

#### ✅ Application Development Platform:
- CHTML provides declarative UI definition
- Module system enables different applications
- MVC structure supports different application types

### 4. Areas for Improvement

#### Potential Architecture Limitations:
1. **Single Large Files**: Each MVC component is in a single large file; could benefit from component-based organization
2. **Tight Integration**: Some coordinate transformation logic exists across view and controller
3. **Static UI Elements**: UI elements are parsed at startup rather than dynamically created
4. **Limited State Management**: State is managed at UI element level rather than application state level

#### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Component-Based Structure**: Break large files into smaller, focused modules
2. **Event System**: Implement more sophisticated event handling for better decoupling
3. **Dynamic UI Creation**: Support runtime UI element creation beyond CHTML parsing
4. **Type Safety**: Consider stronger typing for inter-component communication
5. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for module communication
6. **Testing Framework**: Add hooks for unit testing each component independently

### 5. Future Application Support

The architecture is well-suited for:
- **Game Editor**: UI system can represent game objects, module system can handle game logic
- **DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)**: Timeline UI can be built with CHTML, audio processing in external modules
- **Other Applications**: Any application that benefits from separated UI, logic, and processing

The modular design allows different applications to reuse the core MVC structure while implementing application-specific models and UI elements.
