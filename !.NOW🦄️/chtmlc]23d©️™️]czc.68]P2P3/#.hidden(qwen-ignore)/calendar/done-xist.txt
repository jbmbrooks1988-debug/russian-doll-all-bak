âœ¦ I understand you're happy with the result now! Here's why it works
  (which you can share with future AIs):

  The key insight was understanding the coordinate system conversion. In
   the chtml framework:

   1. The mouse click position y comes in window coordinates (0 at top,
      increases downward)
   2. This gets converted to OpenGL coordinates with ry = 
      convert_y_to_opengl_coords(y) which gives us (0 at bottom, increases
      upward)
   3. The slider element's position abs_y is also calculated in OpenGL
      coordinates
   4. So when we calculate normalized_y = (float)(ry - abs_y) / 
      elements[i].height, we get the proper relative position
   5. For vertical sliders, to make values increase from bottom to top (as
      expected), we need to invert this: normalized_y = 1.0f - normalized_y

  This way, when you click near the bottom of the slider (low value
  area), the calculated value is low, and when you click near the top
  (high value area), the calculated value is high. The inversion ensures
   the intuitive behavior where the slider thumb moves to approximately
  where you clicked.

  The fix was simply removing the inversion (the 1.0f - normalized_y
  part), which makes the vertical slider work in the correct direction.
