âœ¦ Perfect! The code compiled successfully. Now with this change, the 3D
  mode will have consistent coloring with the 2D mode since we've
  temporarily disabled lighting in 3D mode. This ensures that the objects
  will appear with their raw color values, just like in 2D mode.

  When you run the application with this change, the player object in 3D
   mode should now appear with the same blue color as it does in 2D
  mode, providing consistent visual appearance while you continue
  building up the framework.

  The lighting can be re-enabled later when you're ready to implement a
  proper lighting system that maintains the intended colors, but for now
   this change provides the visual consistency you're looking for.

============================
oct-7 : emoji cashing = no crashing ; (pre paint, cuz og paint-mini(ref) crashes )

 Benefits of the Implementation

   - Performance Improvement: Emojis are now rendered only once and
     reused, significantly reducing CPU usage when displaying the same
     emojis repeatedly
   - Memory Efficiency: Texture IDs are generated once and reused,
     avoiding the constant creation/deletion of OpenGL textures
   - Backward Compatibility: All existing functionality remains intact,
     but with better performance
   - Automatic Fallback: When the cache is full, the system falls back to
     direct rendering without crashing

  The implementation has been successfully compiled and is ready for
  use. This optimization will provide significant performance benefits,
  especially in scenarios where the same emojis are displayed multiple
  times across the UI.
