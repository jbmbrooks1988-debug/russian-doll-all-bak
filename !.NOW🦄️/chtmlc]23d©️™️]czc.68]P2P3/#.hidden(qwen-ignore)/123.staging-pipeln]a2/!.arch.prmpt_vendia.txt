# Architecture Comparison for CHTML Framework



Based on analysis of all three implementations, here's my assessment of which is easiest to prompt for new features:

## Easiest: Original Implementation
- **Simplicity**: Single-threaded, straightforward execution flow
- **Debugging**: No multi-threading complexities, race conditions, or synchronization issues to consider
- **Predictable Behavior**: Deterministic execution makes it easier to understand and modify
- **Intuitive Flow**: Linear code structure that's easy to follow from input to output
- **Less Complexity**: Fewer moving parts means fewer potential points of failure when adding features

## Moderately Difficult: Event-Based Architecture
- **Event Loop Complexity**: Requires understanding of non-blocking I/O and event-driven patterns
- **State Management**: Need to keep track of asynchronous state changes
- **Error Handling**: Non-trivial to handle all the various states and error conditions in an event loop

## Most Complex: Multi-Threaded Architecture
- **Thread Safety**: Need to understand mutexes and synchronization
- **Race Conditions**: Potential for subtle bugs that are hard to reproduce
- **Debugging Challenges**: Multi-threaded execution is inherently more difficult to debug
- **Shared State**: Managing state between threads adds complexity

## Recommendation:

**Start with the original** for prompting new features because:
1. It's the most stable and well-understood
2. When you create new modules or CHTML files, you can test them on the original first
3. If you need the performance benefits, you can then migrate working features to the async versions
4. The original serves as a "reference implementation" that you can compare against

The async versions are better for performance in production, but for development and feature prompting, the original's simplicity is a significant advantage.
