# Asynchronous and Non-blocking IPC Implementation for CHTML Framework

## Current Issues
- The current system can block when reading from pipes
- UI updates are tied to module communication
- No proper async handling of module responses

## Proposed Asynchronous Architecture

### 1. Threading Approach
The most straightforward way to make the system non-blocking is to use separate threads:

- Main Thread: Handles UI rendering and user input
- IPC Thread: Handles all communication with the module
- Message Queue: Thread-safe buffer for IPC data

### 2. Implementation Components

#### A. Thread-Safe Data Structures
- Use mutex-protected queues for communication between threads
- Implement atomic operations for shared state variables
- Use condition variables for thread synchronization

#### B. Asynchronous IPC Handler
```c
typedef struct {
    pthread_mutex_t mutex;
    char buffer[4096];
    int data_ready;
    int should_exit;
} ipc_data_t;

void* ipc_thread_func(void* arg) {
    ipc_data_t* data = (ipc_data_t*)arg;
    char local_buffer[4096];
    
    while (!data->should_exit) {
        // Non-blocking read from pipe
        int bytes_read = read_non_blocking(data->pipe_fd, local_buffer, sizeof(local_buffer)-1);
        if (bytes_read > 0) {
            pthread_mutex_lock(&data->mutex);
            memcpy(data->buffer, local_buffer, bytes_read);
            data->buffer[bytes_read] = '\0';
            data->data_ready = 1;
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&data->mutex);
        }
        usleep(1000); // 1ms sleep to prevent busy waiting
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

#### C. Non-blocking Pipe Reading
- Use `fcntl()` to set pipes to non-blocking mode
- Use `select()` or `poll()` to check for available data
- Implement timeout mechanisms to prevent blocking

#### D. Message Queue System
- Implement a thread-safe queue for incoming messages
- Use atomic operations to manage queue state
- Process messages in batches during the idle loop

### 3. Benefits of Async Implementation

- UI remains responsive regardless of module communication status
- No blocking on pipe reads
- Better handling of slow or unresponsive modules
- More predictable frame rates
- Improved user experience

### 4. Technical Implementation Steps

1. Add threading library support (pthread)
2. Create thread-safe data structures for IPC communication
3. Implement a separate thread for module communication
4. Use non-blocking I/O operations
5. Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, condition variables)
6. Add timeout handling for unresponsive modules
7. Integrate with the existing idle loop

### 5. Challenges and Considerations

- Thread safety for shared data structures
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Potential race conditions
- Increased complexity of debugging
- Memory management in multi-threaded environment
- Deadlock prevention

### 6. Alternative: Event Loop Approach

Instead of threads, implement an event-driven architecture:
- Use `select()` or `poll()` to monitor multiple file descriptors
- Process events in a single-threaded event loop
- Maintains simplicity while achieving non-blocking behavior
- Easier to debug than multi-threaded approach

The event loop approach would be simpler to implement and maintain while still providing non-blocking behavior.
