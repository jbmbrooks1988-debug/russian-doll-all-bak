AI Overview
pKa is the negative base-10 logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka). A lower pKa value indicates a stronger acid, meaning it dissociates more readily and donates protons more easily. Conversely, a higher pKa indicates a weaker acid. The pKa is a useful measure for comparing the acidity of different compounds, especially when the pH is known. 
What pKa means:
Acidity Strength: A key characteristic of pKa is that it quantifies an acid's strength. 
Scale: The logarithmic scale makes it easier to work with very small Ka values. 
Conjugate Base: A stronger acid will have a weaker conjugate base, and a weaker acid will have a stronger conjugate base. 
How to use pKa:
Comparing Acids: A lower pKa means a stronger acid. For example, lactic acid (pKa = 3.5) is more acidic than acetic acid (pKa = 4.76). 
Buffer Solutions: In a buffer solution containing a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A-), the relationship between pH and pKa is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). 
Determining Acid vs. Base Form:
If the pH is less than the pKa, the acid is present in its protonated (acidic) form. 
If the pH is equal to the pKa, the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal. 
If the pH is greater than the pKa, the conjugate base form predominates.

The main difference is that alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with only single carbon-carbon bonds, while alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond. This structural difference makes alkenes more reactive than alkanes. Alkenes also show a distinct reaction with bromine water, changing its color from orange to colorless, a test not observed with alkanes. 
Here's a breakdown of their key differences:
Alkanes
Bonding: Contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. 
Saturation: Considered saturated hydrocarbons because they have the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms bonded to their carbon backbone. 
Reactivity: Less reactive than alkenes due to the presence of strong single bonds. 
Example: Methane (CH₄) is the simplest alkane. 
Alkenes
Bonding: Contain at least one double covalent bond between two carbon atoms. 
Saturation: Are unsaturated hydrocarbons because the double bond prevents the carbon chain from holding the maximum number of hydrogen atoms. 
Reactivity: More reactive than alkanes due to the presence of the weaker pi bond in the double bond. 
Key Test: React with bromine water, causing the solution to turn colorless. 
Example: Ethene (C₂H₄) is the simplest alkene.
