# Atomic Structure Corpus 2: Historical Development

## Early Atomic Theories
- Democritus: first to propose atomos (indivisible particles) concept around 400 BCE
- John Dalton: atomic theory in early 1800s stating all matter is made of atoms
- J.J. Thomson: discovered electrons, proposed "plum pudding" model
- Ernest Rutherford: gold foil experiment revealed atomic nucleus
- Niels Bohr: planetary model with electrons in fixed orbits
- Erwin Schr√∂dinger: quantum mechanical model describing electron probability clouds

## Modern Atomic Model
The current quantum mechanical model describes electrons in terms of probability distributions called orbitals, rather than fixed paths. This model incorporates:
- Wave-particle duality
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle
- Quantum numbers that define electron properties
