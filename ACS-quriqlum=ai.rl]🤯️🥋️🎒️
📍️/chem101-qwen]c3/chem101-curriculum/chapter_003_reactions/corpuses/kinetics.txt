## Reaction Rates
Reaction rate measures how fast reactants are converted to products:
- Rate = change in concentration of reactant or product over time
- Factors affecting rate: temperature, concentration, surface area, catalysts
- Rate law: rate = k[A]^m[B]^n, where k is rate constant and m, n are reaction orders

## Activation Energy
- Minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur
- Catalysts lower activation energy without being consumed
- Arrhenius equation relates rate constant to temperature and activation energy

## Collision Theory
For a reaction to occur:
- Reactants must collide with proper orientation
- Collisions must have sufficient energy (â‰¥ activation energy)
- Higher temperatures increase collision frequency and energy

## Reaction Mechanisms
- Elementary steps that make up the overall reaction
- Rate-determining step: slowest step in the mechanism
- Intermediates: species formed in one step and consumed in another
