🥋️i like this so much id do it right now with qwen-cli but my spine is day off'd
👖️
🛹️would be ground breaking. this would be EVERYTHING 4 us (esp if human use 2 ie ♟️cheqers-rl♟️
💫️
🤩️
y i dont do it NOW NOW ? 
ill need a rl / attention ; maybe we should make a more mobile version
but use same "DATA STRUCT" From "3FAME"📁️or access it meta do u dont feel bogged down/ w/e starting fresh wuldn't hurt necessarily ; u could still bring old over if fresh wasn't working🤩️
💫️
👨🏽‍🚀️make it for humans first. ,then make it for 'checkers rl' then attention/mlp👨🏽‍🚀️
🤔️
not just 1 quiz but a series of quizes
🤔️
🤯️
>corpus = do attention  
+quiz  = do rl + use attetion if it helps = somehow combine both weights when pass🤯️

i want to make a mini curriculum for chem 101 
{&later 102etc (pull from student♟️mem)}

3 chapters 
with 3 'corpuses' each , each with a mini quiz
then a final test after each chapter
then a big test of all 3 chapters. 

this is just a demo/proof of concept , because we are going to 
score the human quizes using rl style weight / bias scoring; 
then try to have an  agent take the same quiz using a word bank and rl weights ,
and score them; to see which learns faster human or ai.get it?
step 2 we are going to add an attention mechanism to the weights after
step 1 , so that the rl can use the attention weights and try to 
predict the answer {quizes are 'fill in the blank' so attention prediction should lend itself well to this}

the whole point is to put together a small but functional ai training suite. 


our data model for vocab tokens and weights/biases looks like this: 
number word embedding pe weight bias1 bias2 bias3 bias4

rl data can be stored in bias info , pe & weight are used for attention
u can also use other external .txt files to store data. 

we have a premade llm in 
3.stage.llm]👬🏾️]MoE+rl+dis.cas]917/

so use that instead of reinventing the wheel , when applicable.

each "rl agent" is a "peice or student" and will have their own folder for mem 
ie "student♟️_001/" <- this way we can do science on multiple students human or ai

 good luck <3

🅰️
🆎️look through the folder then write a architectural diagram in arch.md
note :the blank should always come after the question so attention  prediction can be tested
