# Summary of Changes Made

## 1. Created Goals Report
I've analyzed the current implementation and compared it with the roadmap goals in `@tiny-ai.goal🧬🔥]9.17.23.md`, creating a comprehensive report in `goals_report.md`.

## 2. Fixed Causal Attention Implementation
I've fixed the causal attention implementation in `attention.c` to properly read the causal attention setting from the config file instead of hardcoding it to 0.


- ❌ Not yet implemented behavior trees with LLM proxy
- ❌ Not yet implemented SD-Emoji renderer

Only about 80% of the roadmap goals have been achieved so far. The project has a solid foundation but needs work to achieve the sophisticated capabilities described in the roadmap.
