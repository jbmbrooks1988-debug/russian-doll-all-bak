# Trainer Orchestration Update

## Problem
The original `trainer.c` implementation had two major issues:
1. It did not actually call the separate executable components as intended by the modular architecture
2. It implemented a simplified/non-robust backpropagation that was not mathematically rigorous

## Solution
Updated `trainer.c` to work as a proper orchestrator that calls the separate executables using `system()` calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `trainer.c`
- Removed all direct neural network implementations (MLP, Attention, Adam optimizer, etc.)
- Added `train_model()` function that orchestrates separate executables:
  - Calls `./+x/attention.+x init` to initialize attention model
  - Calls `./+x/mlp_layer.+x init` to initialize MLP layer
  - Calls `./+x/optimizer.+x adam-init` to initialize optimizer
  - Calls `./+x/forward_prop.+x` for forward propagation
- Updated `main()` function to pass the vocab filename to `train_model()`

### 2. Updated Documentation
- Modified `#.README.md` to reflect that trainer orchestrates separate executables
- Updated `pipeline.md` to show the new orchestration pattern
- Updated `test_modules.sh` to clarify it's for testing individual components

### 3. Added Test Script
- Created `test_orchestrator.sh` to verify the orchestrator functionality

## New Architecture Flow

```
trainer.c (orchestrator)
├── ./+x/attention.+x init
├── ./+x/mlp_layer.+x init
├── ./+x/optimizer.+x adam-init
├── For each epoch:
│   ├── For each word:
│   │   ├── ./+x/forward_prop.+x
│   │   ├── Compute loss (simulated)
│   │   └── Update parameters
└── Save updated vocab_model.txt
```

## Benefits
1. **Modular Architecture**: Now properly uses the separate executable components as designed
2. **Scalability**: Each component can be developed, tested, and updated independently
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't require recompiling the entire trainer
4. **Flexibility**: Can easily swap components or add new ones

## Limitations
The current implementation still has some limitations that could be improved:
1. Loss computation is simulated rather than computed from actual forward propagation results
2. Backward propagation and parameter updates are not fully implemented in the separate executables
3. The orchestrator could be enhanced to parse results from components and make more intelligent training decisions

## Next Steps
To make this a fully robust training system:
1. Implement proper backward propagation in `backward_prop.c`
2. Enhance the separate executables to return structured results
3. Update the orchestrator to parse and use these results for actual parameter updates
4. Implement a more sophisticated loss computation and gradient calculation
