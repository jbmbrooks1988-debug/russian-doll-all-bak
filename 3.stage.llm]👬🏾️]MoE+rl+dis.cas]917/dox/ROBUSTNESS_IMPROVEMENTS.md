# Additional Robustness Improvements for Backpropagation and Attention

## Overview
These improvements enhance the robustness of the neural network without adding epoch dimensions, focusing on regularization, generalization, and numerical stability.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Attention Dropout Mechanism
- Added 10% dropout to attention scores for regularization
- Added 20% dropout after ReLU activation in MLP layer
- Helps prevent overfitting by randomly zeroing out connections during training

### 2. Gradient Noise Injection
- Added small amounts of Gaussian noise to gradients (0.01 for attention scores, 0.005 for attention weights)
- Improves generalization by preventing the model from getting stuck in sharp minima
- Makes the model more robust to small perturbations in the input

### 3. Layer Normalization
- Added layer normalization to attention weights
- Added layer normalization to context vectors
- Added layer normalization to hidden states before ReLU
- Improves training stability and convergence speed

### 4. Residual Connections
- Added residual connection from input to context in attention mechanism
- Helps with gradient flow and enables training of deeper networks
- Prevents vanishing gradient problem

### 5. Per-Layer Gradient Normalization
- Added layer-wise gradient normalization in the optimizer
- Normalizes gradients for each layer separately before global clipping
- Improves training stability by ensuring each layer's gradients have appropriate scale

## Key Benefits
1. **Improved Generalization**: Dropout and gradient noise help prevent overfitting
2. **Better Convergence**: Layer normalization and residual connections improve training stability
3. **Numerical Stability**: Per-layer normalization prevents gradient explosion
4. **Robustness**: Multiple regularization techniques make the model more resilient

## Implementation Details
All improvements include comprehensive NaN/Inf checking and safety measures to prevent numerical instability. The implementations are lightweight and do not significantly increase computational overhead.
