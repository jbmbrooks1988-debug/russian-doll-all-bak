# Fix Summary for NaN/Inf Issues in Neural Network Implementation

## Issues Identified
1. Numerical instability in softmax function causing overflow/underflow
2. Lack of proper NaN/Inf checking in gradient computations
3. Insufficient gradient clipping leading to gradient explosion
4. Static buffer allocation that could cause memory issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved Softmax Function (forward_prop.c)
- Added better numerical stability with improved max finding
- Added overflow/underflow protection with clamping
- Added final safety checks for NaN/Inf values
- Added uniform distribution fallback for edge cases

### 2. Enhanced Gradient Computations (backward_prop.c)
- Added NaN/Inf checking for all gradient computations
- Added safety checks before mathematical operations
- Improved gradient clipping with proper norm calculation
- Added dynamic buffer allocation for all arrays
- Initialized all gradient arrays to zero to prevent undefined behavior

### 3. Improved Optimizer (optimizer.c)
- Enhanced gradient clipping with NaN/Inf checking
- Improved Adam update function with safety checks
- Added proper handling of edge cases in bias correction
- Added final parameter safety checks

### 4. Dynamic Buffer Allocation
- Converted all static arrays to dynamically allocated buffers
- Added proper memory cleanup for all allocated buffers
- Added initialization of arrays to prevent undefined behavior

## Key Improvements
1. **Numerical Stability**: All mathematical operations now include proper checks for NaN/Inf values
2. **Memory Management**: All buffers are now dynamically allocated and properly freed
3. **Gradient Clipping**: Enhanced clipping with proper norm calculation and safety checks
4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for edge cases
5. **Safety Checks**: Added safety checks at every computation step to prevent invalid values
