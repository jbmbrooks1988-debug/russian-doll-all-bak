ai momentum velocity


gcc c program that takes in .txt files as args, 
makes a vocab  , 
then does sgd + momentum to find similiarity from 
word 

(prompt user for word)

give similiarity score also

📍️aug6. the REAL 2 do is 2 get a simple llm maybe even 🇱🇰️, 
make tests for it, manipulate the weights so u can literally see logits change pic , etc
and we can take it from there basically do w/e we want...
(and wat we want it to do peice integration, make tools/bench♏️, hardcode biases 4 ♋️, etc

wut about rl? wut about rag? m8 we just need 2 see biases change logits, 
(+ maybe doing that "1 word association score thingi)
(but yea then we may start adding knowledge distillation (learning) + curliq (hard) + ? 
& creation of mods? can it be hardcoded 2 create template mods + tack on shit
ie hardcoding executable? meta learning and stuff where does that fall . w/e lets gooo

dont think just push🏎️

🧠️dont worry about forgettign brilliant little arch thingy for lmm. -jc

🦽️->🦼️-> 🏍️

ie :
🦽️- home made , not attached 2 peice logic
🦽️-homemade , attached 2 1p peices; running ♟️ai rl/ biases<-will be big (tracked biases)🚇️
🏍️ -> interacting with others items, physics ready 2 code out wu again. 

👩🏻‍🦼️👩🏻‍🦽️
once we do this i bet we can also see solutinos for training against "llama2" or ollama3
that these llm's have no idea about 
(but vaugely have hinted @ ie : knowledge distilation scores♏️💯️

👩🏻‍🏫️dont worry about compabitibility we can come back up 2 that, i 
rather have smol but moving/working movable metrix even if i have 2 use biases w.e🚇️
👩🏻‍🦼️👩🏻‍🦽️
when we move 2 gpu we will have max leverage + already have min provability 💝️
🦪️
wut if no gpu's work? still gonn be enuff 2 do game bias stuff & learn'
+ others can train numeriar, till we bootstrap cash🦪️

🍀️ ai as an os . do this with gemini.oncli. on desktop. 
just have it loop till whenever toekns "unexpire 4 free" 
and create its own training programs etc. {everything can be a .txt = weights/keywords/executes. w/e }🍀️
