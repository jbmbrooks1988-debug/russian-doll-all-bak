currently this code is for a ai chatbot for newb devs


## For Developers

### `trainer`

The `trainer` module now includes a simplified implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a self-attention mechanism. The backpropagation implementation is highly simplified and is intended to be a conceptual demonstration rather than a mathematically rigorous one. It does not use a formal loss function and the gradients are approximated.

### `chatbot`

The `chatbot` module now uses temperature sampling to generate more varied responses. The prediction logic is still basic and does not implement a full attention mechanism. The `current_word_index` is used to influence the next word's prediction by calculating a dot product between the current word's vector and all other words in the vocabulary.

no new or custom headers, i rather use executable modules using system() or pipe
so we can easily see the different functions and read them on their own. 

if they need to share data we want external .txt for better data visualization

also we want to refactor the current code to run executables out of the +/ directory using the script in that directory to compile the code (not a makefile)

📍️aug6. the REAL 2 do is 2 get a simple llm maybe even 🇱🇰️, 
make tests for it, manipulate the weights so u can literally see logits change pic , etc
and we can take it from there basically do w/e we want...
(and wat we want it to do peice integration, make tools/bench♏️, hardcode biases 4 ♋️, etc

wut about rl? wut about rag? m8 we just need 2 see biases change logits, 
(+ maybe doing that "1 word association score thingi)
(but yea then we may start adding knowledge distillation (learning) + curliq (hard) + ? 
& creation of mods? can it be hardcoded 2 create template mods + tack on shit
ie hardcoding executable? meta learning and stuff where does that fall . w/e lets gooo

dont think just push🏎️

🧠️dont worry about forgettign brilliant little arch thingy for lmm. -jc

🦽️->🦼️-> 🏍️

ie :
🦽️- home made , not attached 2 peice logic
🦽️-homemade , attached 2 1p peices; running ♟️ai rl/ biases<-will be big (tracked biases)🚇️
🏍️ -> interacting with others items, physics ready 2 code out wu again. 

👩🏻‍🦼️👩🏻‍🦽️
once we do this i bet we can also see solutinos for training against "llama2" or ollama3
that these llm's have no idea about 
(but vaugely have hinted @ ie : knowledge distilation scores♏️💯️

👩🏻‍🏫️dont worry about compabitibility we can come back up 2 that, i 
rather have smol but moving/working movable metrix even if i have 2 use biases w.e🚇️
👩🏻‍🦼️👩🏻‍🦽️
when we move 2 gpu we will have max leverage + already have min provability 💝️
🦪️
wut if no gpu's work? still gonn be enuff 2 do game bias stuff & learn'
+ others can train numeriar, till we bootstrap cash🦪️

🍀️ ai as an os . do this with gemini.oncli. on desktop. 
just have it loop till whenever toekns "unexpire 4 free" 
and create its own training programs etc. {everything can be a .txt = weights/keywords/executes. w/e }🍀️
