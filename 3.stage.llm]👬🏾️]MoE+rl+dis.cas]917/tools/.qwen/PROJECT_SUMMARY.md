# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix the emoji rendering issue in the `visualize_associations.c` program so that emojis display properly with correct colors and sizing, similar to the example implementation.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses OpenGL with FreeType for rendering color emojis
- Emojis should be rendered using the Noto Color Emoji font at `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto/NotoColorEmoji.ttf`
- The example implementation in `0.candy.crushüç¨Ô∏è]emoji_example.c` correctly renders emojis with proper scaling and colors
- Emojis are being loaded from a CSV file (`emoji_associations.csv`) that contains emoji data for visualization
- The program uses FreeType with `FT_LOAD_COLOR` and `FT_PIXEL_MODE_BGRA` for color emoji support
- Key rendering functions include `render_emoji()` for emoji rendering and `decode_utf8()` for UTF-8 handling
- The build process uses a script at `+x/xsath.compile-all.+x]üîòÔ∏è.sh` that compiles with `-lfreetype` and other required libraries

## Recent Actions
- Identified that emojis were rendering as black squares due to color state management issues
- Fixed the color bleeding problem by ensuring `glColor3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)` is called before emoji rendering
- Adjusted emoji sizing by modifying `NODE_RADIUS` and implementing proper scaling calculations
- Reverted to a simpler emoji rendering approach that works reliably (removing experimental texture caching)
- Successfully compiled the program after fixing various issues with function definitions and references
- Removed incomplete texture caching implementation that was causing compilation errors

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Fix basic emoji rendering to display colored emojis instead of black squares
2. [DONE] Adjust emoji sizing to match the example implementation
3. [DONE] Remove non-working texture caching implementation
4. [TODO] Re-implement emoji texture caching for performance improvement
5. [TODO] Fine-tune emoji positioning and scaling for optimal visualization
6. [TODO] Test the final implementation with various emoji datasets
