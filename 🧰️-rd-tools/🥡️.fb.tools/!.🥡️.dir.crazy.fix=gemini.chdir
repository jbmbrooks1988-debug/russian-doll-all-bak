 Okay, I've analyzed the code. The problem is exactly as I suspected:

   1. 1.interact_xp_dirs🗯️]x7.c uses relative paths to open its configuration files (e.g.,
      fopen("interact_lut.txt", "r")). It expects these files to be in the directory from
      which it is run.
   2. 4.button🔘️.🪄️🔮️📲️]d6]SUP.c reads a list of commands from locations.txt and executes
      them. It does not change the working directory before running them.

  The fix is to modify 4.button... so that it changes to the correct directory before
  executing the script. The most direct way to do this is to add a chdir command before
  the system call.

  Here is the plan:
   1. Read the locations.txt file to understand how the commands are structured.
   2. Modify 4.button🔘️.🪄️🔮️📲️]d6]SUP.c to parse the directory from the command path,
      chdir into it, and then execute the command.

  First, I'll read locations.txt.
